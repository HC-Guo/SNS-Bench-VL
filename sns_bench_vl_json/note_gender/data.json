Previously, I accidentally saw a Japanese bridal magazine where the model used white geometric nail designs that looked particularly elegant and beautiful [ColorfulR]. I immediately searched through Instagram to collect several super high-end nail art works. Simple geometric patterns are considered low-key but have a unique charm.\n\nBright colors, retro colors + gold accents are definitely a safe choice [CuteR].\n\nMonochrome + triangle diamonds have a very goddess feel. This design is one that I saw and immediately asked to have done outside. You can directly copy it, and it still looks good even as your nails grow [MilkTeaR].\n\nI'm planning to get a set of red nails with gold accents to celebrate the New Year at the end of the year!!

Some people have lost 5 pounds in a week using this diet🤫\n\n~\n\n🌈The formula for the one-week efficient weight loss meal plan is as follows:\n\n✨Breakfast: Staple food + egg + dairy\n\n✨Lunch: Staple food + meat + vegetables\n\n✨Dinner: Staple food + vegetables\n\n⚠Actually, this diet meal plan formula is not the only one; you can make changes as you like. For example, you can split the meat into two meals, eat meat🥩 for dinner and none for lunch, adjusting according to your habits.\n\n~\n\n🌈Food choices for the one-week efficient weight loss meal plan:\n\n✨Staple foods for fat-reducing meals: Mixed grain rice, brown rice, sweet potato🍠, corn🌽, potato🥔, purple sweet potato, pumpkin, Italian pasta, etc.\n\n✨Meats for weight loss meals: Lean meat, beef, fish and shrimp, skinless chicken and duck\n\n✨Vegetables for weight loss recipes: Leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables🥦, mushrooms, etc. basically all can be eaten, but avoid starchy vegetables.\n\n~\n\n🌈Examples of the one-week efficient weight loss meal plan:\n\n⚡Breakfast for fat-reducing meal: Purple sweet potato + egg + soy milk\n\n⚡Lunch for slimming meal: Black rice + shrimp stir-fried with broccoli + cold mixed spinach\n\n⚡Dinner for weight loss meal: Corn + cabbage and tofu soup\n\n~\n\n👉This weight loss meal plan doesn't specify exact grams because many people have said they can't measure grams, some eat out, and some eat with their families.\n\n👉So this diet meal plan is based on one serving per plate, eaten as you like😊, vegetables to fill up, moderate amounts of meat, a flat bowl of rice, a small sweet potato or purple sweet potato, one corn.\n\n~\n\n🌈Specific one-week efficient weight loss meal plan (👉see image)\n\n✨The fat-reducing meal plan recommended today is improved based on the feedback from sweet potato lovers, modifying the basic weight loss meal plan, and you can make further improvements.\n\n✨For example: If you love white rice, you can eat half a bowl; if you can't live without fruits, you can add a small fruit to your diet as a snack.\n\n~\n\n🌈Many people eat less, feel like they've eaten a lot in their fat-reducing meals, but still don't lose weight, mostly due to issues with their diet structure. Therefore, to lose weight, you need to adjust your diet structure, and you can slim down effortlessly.\n\n👉The one-week efficient weight loss meal plan recommended today can help you slim down healthily and won't rebound. Start eating your fat-reducing meals now‼️\nImage as shown.\""

It was when I went to a friend's place that I discovered the za isolation that I had been wanting to try but hadn't bought yet, the one shown in the picture. After using it, I felt it was quite good, so I bought one to try. When applying it at school, there might be very slight balling up or none at all. Then, when I got home, I still used the same skincare products, but it balled up so much that I doubted my life! The skincare products hadn't changed, but maybe if the previous layer of skincare hadn't been fully absorbed before applying the isolation, it wouldn't ball up as much. If it's absorbed, it balls up?\nWhat kind of situation is this? The information on Xiaohongshu and the general public is different!\nI want to ask if anyone else has experienced the same thing, and if there's any solution...\nImage as shown.\""

The Lady also maintains the usual standard of Uma, it's fabulous!\nHere is a very subjective comparison for all my sisters to reference:\n1. The adjustment buckle is different. The Lady uses a YKK adjustment buckle, while Hanazakura uses a non-adjustable three-stage copper buckle.\n2. The composition is different. The Lady is 50% wool, while Hanazakura is 30% wool.\n3. The style is different. The Lady has a straight tube style, while Hanazakura is a very obvious A-line skirt.\n4. The plaid is different. The Lady's plaid is very neatly aligned and pressed very flat, while Hanazakura's plaid is irregularly pressed and not very flat.\n5. The degree of whitening is different. The Lady does not whiten, it shows the skin's natural color, while Hanazakura whitens significantly, it feels like it can enhance the skin tone!\nIn summary, both are classic green Japanese plaids, instantly turning you into the most elegant cherry blossom 🌸 sister of autumn! So amazing, so amazing, sisters, hurry up and go for it!\nLastly, there might be an outfit photo later, dismissed!\nThe image is as shown.\""

The entire wedding uses champagne and gold colors, adorned with luxurious lighting, crystal bead chains, and other linear materials to create a fashionable, cutting-edge, and warm visual presentation.\nYou say that the cities you've lived in will leave their mark on your character for life.\nIn this life, whichever city you choose, I am willing to be your shadow 💫💫\nFlower Field Celebrations create the perfect wedding.\n\nImage as shown.\""

Since it's a bit far, I chose the nearby Jiangbei District People's Hospital.\n📌Although the airline doesn't require it, I chose an institution certified on the State Council's app for safety and it can issue Chinese-English test reports (Image 5 attached with hospitals nationwide that can issue Chinese-English test reports).\n📌Those who get tested before 10 a.m. can collect their report after 3 p.m. the same day.\n📌Asked at the consultation desk to bring my passport when collecting the report in the afternoon.\n📌Arrived at 9:30, paid at the automatic payment machine at the entrance, and went for the test. Not many people in line, waited about 5 minutes. The testing site thoughtfully provided different report collection processes and locations for different patients.\n📌Came back at 3:30 p.m. to collect the report, it was ready. At the exit of the elevator on the 4th floor of the outpatient building, provided my passport number and pinyin to the staff, and got the report after about 5 minutes.\n📌Went back to the 1st floor consultation desk for a stamp.\nAfterwards, walked 10 minutes to Beicheng Tianjie to meet up with friends for dinner. The hospital's location is very convenient for reference. Hope everything goes smoothly for my trip tomorrow.\n\nImage as shown.\""

Proper hydration beforehand prevents flaking. \nFor those with light yellow skin tone, I personally prefer a whiter effect. Tried PO-01 and it was completely okay. Previous shades felt dull on the face and didn't stay white for long.\nThis packaging is so gentle, personally feels better than the previous rose red hhh.

Why? So you can fit into another pair of thermal pants in winter! I won't tell you how I discovered this truth 🤨\nThere are no shortcuts to weight loss, it's all about 'controlling your diet and exercising', and persistence. This path is incredibly difficult, and there are always times when your mouth can't resist, so you need to stock up on low-calorie foods that are not easy to gain weight from.\n🚘 Recently, I often keep a bottle of Guanzhan Barley Instant Fish Glue in my car, just in case I'm too hungry after working out 🏋 and can't eat anything at night. At times like this, gulping down a bottle of instant fish glue doesn't give me much guilt, since it only has 274 kJ per 100g, even lower in calories than soy milk, a blessing for the weight loss period.\nEveryone knows that bird's nest is nourishing, but it's expensive. Actually, fish glue is also very nutritious, especially for women. ☝️ Many Hong Kong actresses love fish glue. As the saying goes: ten doses of Chinese medicine are not as effective as fish glue! But here's the problem, I don't know how to choose or cook it 😑 Besides the many tricks in selection, just soaking alone takes 10 hours. Thank heavens for the convenience of online shopping, where you can buy ready-to-eat bottled fish glue.\n🛍 I chose Guanzhan Barley Instant Fish Glue, which has been specializing in fish glue for 19 years. Just open and eat, as convenient as drinking a beverage. No need for soaking, stewing, or seasoning, and it tastes great. 😱 Super tender and smooth, with a slight sweetness, not fishy or oily. 🐟 The fish glue is super bouncy, and the barley grains are chewy, combining for a delicious complex texture.\n💁 For those who are preparing for pregnancy or already pregnant hot moms, this warm and nourishing food is also highly recommended. Soluble dietary fiber is very beneficial for expectant mothers.\nImage as shown.\""

Stridex\nContent: For someone like me with oily skin, my face easily breaks out in acne, which is very distressing. I feel annoyed every day just washing my face, which is uncomfortable to touch. Recently, I heard about a very popular Stridex salicylic acid cotton pad, so I decided to give it a try and bought a box. It's genuinely effective; this Stridex salicylic acid cotton pad not only helps with acne but also blackheads and pimples are terrified of it 😏. As the pioneer of alcohol-free salicylic acid cotton pads, it has been a global bestseller for over 60 years, with safety and effectiveness verified by hundreds of millions of people!\nStridex Stridex Salicylic Acid Cleansing Cotton Pads\nWith a salicylic acid content of 0.5%, it is alcohol-free and water-based, not overburdening the skin. Plus, it also serves as a secondary cleanser, truly multi-functional, solving various facial issues in one box ✌️✌️✌️\nThe price is also very affordable, with 55 pieces per box. The airtight design allows for easy use anytime, very convenient. It's clean, hygienic, and cost-effective. Moreover, the cotton pads do not shed fibers, making them an excellent choice for secondary cleansing morning and night to prevent acne and clogged pores. After daily cleansing, take out a cotton pad and gently wipe the entire face with the textured side, no need to rinse. Once dry, you can proceed with your regular skincare routine. In the morning, after cleansing and wiping the face, apply skincare and makeup for a more adherent and natural look, suitable for those new to salicylic acid products, and suitable for all skin types.\nImage as shown.\""

Whether you do antioxidant or not, the effect will be seen the next day, it's that magical! Just turned 26! Start antioxidant now!!!\n🌟 The first product I tried was the Phyto Corrective, for fading red acne marks, correcting redness, and soothing sensitivity. Apply it immediately after a pimple bursts, and it will fade the next day, but the subsequent effect is weaker, so you need to stick with it. I don't use much, but with it, I have no fears!\n🌟 B5 hydrating and moisturizing, daily stabilizing, like the air, moisturizing silently. No instant wow factor, but for my desert dry skin, I can't do without it, after all, this is a serum, not just ordinary lotion. I use it up super fast [smirking R][laughing-crying R]\n🌟 H.A Purple Rice Serum, I chose it because it's said to make the skin bouncy, my skin is quite sunken, and if the 15ml is finished, the effect really improves! I will definitely repurchase it endlessly!\n⚠️\nNever encountered the issue of pilling, I apply the serum directly after toner, subsequent pilling might be due to poor initial absorption. Skincare is not about applying more or various products, but rather simplifying for doubled effectiveness.\nAlso, make yourself sweat, detox the skin, for better subsequent absorption\n@MakeupPotato @DailyPotato @MakeupIntelligenceBureau\nImage as shown.\""

A Comprehensive Shooting Tutorial\nContent: [Golden Potato R] Best shooting time:\n10 minutes before sunset and 20 minutes after sunset, when it's dark but not completely black, the sky is a very nice dark blue at this time, make sure to seize those ten minutes in between. Shooting too early is too bright and the fireworks are not clear, shooting too late when it's fully dark results in a black background with no content and it doesn't look good.\n-\n[Golden Potato R] Location:\nOpen areas, mountains, riverbanks, beaches, rooftops, or suitable environments like in the movie 'Kamakura Diary'.\n-\n[Golden Potato R] Clothing: Non-dark clothes are suitable, except for photography experts.\n-\n[Golden Potato R] Shooting tips:\n👉 Continuous shooting. Fireworks are bright and dim, continuous shooting ensures capturing the bright moment.\n👉 Plan your actions in advance. Because the fairy stick burns very quickly.\n👉 Fairy sticks come in different lengths, buy longer ones, especially when photographing children to capture the fireworks blooming on them.\n👉 If a child wants to photograph the fairy stick, they need to fully cooperate, how to hold it and where to stand should be discussed with them in advance.\n-\n[Golden Potato R] Camera settings:\nFor fireworks, you don't need the camera to automatically expose to normal brightness, and you might even need to reduce exposure to create an atmosphere.\n1️⃣ Recommended M mode:\n👉 Aperture, 1.4-4, using the maximum aperture of the lens\n👉 Shutter speed: 1/60-1/125, not too slow to ensure a safe shutter speed, too slow and the person will be blurry, not too fast as the environment is already dark meaning a high ISO is needed, if the shutter speed is too fast the ISO will need to be even higher and the image quality will be worse, and this shutter speed can capture the fireworks blooming in strands.\n👉 ISO: Each camera lens has different ISO capabilities, for my set it was a few hundred, the light brightness changes at that time, adjust to the brightness shown in my photos.\n2️⃣ A mode: Similar to M mode, need to reduce exposure compensation\n3️⃣ Of course, a phone can also be used\n-\n[Golden Potato R] Post-processing:\nA key step, adjust the color temperature to blue, pull the parameters to a suitable blue, if you've followed my instructions above, post-processing can almost be ignored, saturation can be adjusted to preference.\n-\n｜Children's Portraits｜Hangzhou Photo Shoot｜Family Photos｜Parent-Child Photos｜Graduation Photos｜Children's Photography｜Baby Photos｜Hangzhou Photography｜Photography Tutorials｜\nThe image is as shown.\""

Nine-steamed and nine-sun-dried black sesame balls, recommended by a friend before, and the pulse reading also indicated a bit of kidney deficiency (most women have it). Usually, I lack energy and don't like to move around, so I eat more because black foods nourish the kidneys. These sesame balls are really delicious and good for the kidneys [Thumbs Up R]. I usually take one before bed at night, as the effect is better at night.\n2. Black bean powder, no need to say much about this, those preparing for pregnancy know it. The one I bought also contains nuts, walnuts, etc. I usually have a bowl in the morning, and it tastes like black sesame paste when mixed, which can be a direct breakfast.\n3. Foot bath soak bags, treating winter diseases in summer. I usually like to eat cold foods and have a bit of cold constitution. Soaking my feet in hot water in summer can make me sweat instantly, expelling cold and dampness. I also like foot massages, and I really enjoy this activity [Thumbs Up R].\n4. Sili'an folic acid tablets, I take one every night.\n5. Planning to have some fun during this period, exercising every night, both for physical fitness and weight loss.\nToday, with my period coming, I feel especially good, at least it didn't delay. After my period, I can plan again next week, entering a new anticipation [Thumbs Up R].\nImage as shown.\""

The SA said there was no stock in Taipei or Shanghai and wasn't sure when it would be restocked, so I could only console myself with saving some money. Then a few days ago, I couldn't sleep at midnight and checked my email, only to find a notification from the official website the day before saying it was in stock. I went to the Singapore website and found it was still out of stock, then refreshed to the global website which prompted me to switch to the local store, and then I managed to snag it! It felt inexplicably magical!\n\nAfter it was shipped, I realized it was coming from the US, which confused me, but I was just happy to have bought it. The packaging box was also very beautiful, and I think the actual item is slightly darker than the picture, but it's still very beautiful. Don't give up, girls who want to buy it, check your emails or visit the official website regularly.\n\nI hope all you girls can get the things you like ❤️\nThe image is as shown.\""
