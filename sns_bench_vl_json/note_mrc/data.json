For example, if the length, width, and height of the gestational sac are 40, 19, and 29 millimeters respectively, the gestational age is (40 + 19 + 29) / 3 + 25 = 54 days, approximately 7 weeks. If the embryo length is 1.06 centimeters, the gestational age is 1.06 + 6.5 = 7.56, approximately 7 weeks and 4 days.\""
