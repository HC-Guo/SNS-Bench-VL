From the capture of the dynamic postures of the characters to the depiction of their images, it is all very impressive. Due to the limited circulation, it is relatively rare in the market. From the partial image of the original p2, you can also see that the Ukiyo-e artist used \"mica powder\" to represent the starry night sky, which cannot be felt without handling it. It can also be said that this is a work full of sincerity.\n\nMany people may have a question when looking at the picture: it is clearly marked as the Rakshasa woman, but why do you say she is Princess Iron Fan? According to ancient texts, the Rakshasa woman is a beautiful female ghost who eats people, and there is no mention in \"Journey to the West\" that Princess Iron Fan eats people. In fact, it is already explained in the original \"Journey to the West\" that when Wukong went to the Banana Cave to borrow the fan, he asked a woodcutter about the Banana Cave and the Iron Fan Immortal. The woodcutter told Wukong, \"Although there is a Banana Cave, there is no Iron Fan Immortal, only a Princess Iron Fan, also known as the Rakshasa woman.\" Therefore, the Rakshasa woman is just another name for Princess Iron Fan. As for the name Rakshasa woman, it is likely due to malicious speculation by others about a beautiful woman living in the wilderness.\n\nThis work originates from a private collector's share\n\nCombine the image content to judge the relevance of the query to the content.

The name comes from Turkish, meaning \"the best wool\" with good elasticity, pressure resistance, and special luster, making it an excellent material for making long pile fabrics, and one of the high-end animal textile fiber materials in the world market.\n‚úÖ Mohair, similar in appearance to long wool, has a smooth fiber surface, strong luster, high strength, good elasticity, few curls, and is easy to wash. Mohair can be used for jacquard blankets, long-haired overcoats, and high-luster wool fabrics.\n‚úÖ Advantages of Mohair?\nSpecial Luster: The scales of mohair are flat and close to the wool shaft, rarely overlapping, so the fiber surface is smooth, with a natural bright color, and a unique silk-like luster that is unique among textile fibers.\nHigh Durability: The fibers are soft, have good durability, good resilience, abrasion resistance, and dust and stain resistance, are less prone to pilling, and are easy to clean and wash.\nEasy to Dye: Mohair has good affinity for dyes, the fibers rarely bend, and are more sensitive to some chemical agents than ordinary wool, having better dyeing properties.\n‚úÖ How to care for Mohair?\nMohair originally referred to a high-quality type of goat wool, while most of the mohair supplied on the market is produced with chemical fiber materials as \"imitation mohair\". Due to the long and soft pile of mohair, some consumers are at a loss as to how to wash and care for it, fearing that the pile will shed, lie flat, and mat. In fact, mohair fabrics can be both dry-cleaned and washed.\nFor dry cleaning, light oil or dry cleaning agents can be used, adopting a local spray brushing method. For washing, use high-quality detergents mixed with warm water for soaking, then gently knead and wash, and after rinsing, use a silk and wool softener for softening treatment. When drying, it is advisable to first hang the garment in a nylon mesh bag to drain the water, and then hang it on a hanger to dry. Mohair clothing should not be washed in a washing machine on medium or fast speeds; if necessary, the mohair clothing should be placed in a laundry bag and rinsed on a slow speed. It should be noted that mohair fabrics are strictly prohibited from ironing. When not wearing, hang the clothing on a hanger in the wardrobe, avoiding heavy pressure, so as not to flatten the pile and lose its luster.\nCombine the image content to judge the relevance of the query to the content.

I clearly remember that I took the shade Happy. Because I really liked this case, I didn't throw it away for a long time, and every time I used the blush, I took it out of the paper case (experiencing the feeling of using something new each time). I am particularly sensitive to text and letters, so I remember the font of the word Happy on the paper case very clearly.\n\nAfter some time, I gave the blush to my mom because I felt that this light peach pink was very similar to the tarte I already had. Then in November 2023, I was browsing rarebeauty at Sephora in Hong Kong and saw the shade Grace, which is more purplish-red. I thought it looked pretty good too, so I ordered one on Taobao (the price in Hong Kong was much higher).\n\nThe amazing thing was, after I got home, I found that the Happy I gave to my mom was actually also Grace, which means I now have two Graces. The problem is, I am very sure that I took Happy in Thailand because I can't forget the font of Happy.\n\nBut now, looking at the photos I took in Phuket before, I photographed the rarebeauty shelf, and the photo shows there was no Happy, only Grace.

It's summer, and I've always wanted a white bag, so I directly asked if they had a white Mini Evelyne. The sales associate didn't answer and asked if I was a new customer and suggested I create a profile first. Then he asked me to wait while he checked if they had any bags. I waited for about five to eight minutes, and in between, he came out to tell me to sit for a bit longer. Then he came out with a box saying they had a new white color to see if I liked it.

Preparation method: Mix the puree with lemon juice and heat to between 20-40 degrees, add all powder mixtures, boil to 105 degrees, add lemon acid solution and mix well, pour on a silicone mat to spread and cool, put into a piping bag for later use. (Matcha Madeleine batter) Sugar 300g, eggs 410g, flour 480g, matcha powder 40g, baking powder 26g, milk 180g, honey 90g, rum 25g, butter 530g. Preparation method: Mix sugar and eggs evenly [eggs need to be at room temperature], add the powder mixture and mix well, gradually add the milk, honey, and rum mixture and mix well, finally add the butter heated to 40-45 degrees gradually and mix well [the prepared batter needs to be refrigerated overnight with plastic wrap touching the surface before use].

I often use nail polish gel sealant to directly brush on (Picture 2 is before brushing, Picture 3.4 is after brushing and drying), apply it thickly, and cure it under the light! It needs about seven or eight minutes to dry completely. This coating can last at least 3 months after drying, it's especially wear-resistant, doesn't stick fingerprints, and beats all protectors on the market! Even if your bracelet already has many scratches, applying this will give you the same effect as mine now, with no visible scratches. After sealing, you don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched or the protector accidentally coming off when swiping the access card with the bracelet. When it's time, the edges will peel, just tear it off and reapply, it doesn't damage the screen. All my bracelets are done this way, but my tempered sealant has some glitter in it, so it's a bit sparkly~\nCombine the picture content to judge the relevance of the query to the content.

Extremely cost-effective.\n[Star R] cpb Radiant Foundation BF10\nHigh lasting power, very beautiful makeup effect, giving a natural glowing skin feel. Tried various application methods, and found that the rough method of taking a blob in the palm and spreading it directly on the face works best. The downside is low coverage; for acne marks, it can be compensated with local concealer, but for large areas of redness or uneven skin tone, this foundation is not recommended as it cannot cover redness and is not easy to handle with concealer products.\n[Star R] LP Foundation tender ivory\nGood coverage, has a makeup feel, like dw, suitable for blemished skin, better than dw as it doesn't darken. The accompanying concealer is great for highlighting the tear troughs, I use its concealer for highlighting even when I'm not using this foundation.\n[Star R] excia Cooling Foundation oc101\nAbove-average coverage, doesn't darken, good lasting power, the downside is it's a bit picky about skin condition, can't help in dire situations. Actually more recommend the bee jelly, it's more adherent. excia's shade is my absolute match, so over the past ten years, come rain or shine, I always replenish either the cooling or bee jelly.\n[Star R] twany century Foundation ocb/pob\nFinished the one in the picture, this is also an old friend I've used for over ten years, both new and old versions. It can be said to be the most comprehensive bottle, with no obvious shortcomings in coverage, lasting power, darkening, or overall makeup effect, an absolute all-rounder. But for me, shade ocb is too dark, pob too pink, so I haven't repurchased recently. Several foundations in the Kanebo international counter have oca, why not add the oca shade to tw soon? When there's oca, I'll continue to love it.\n\nCombine the image content to judge the relevance of the query to the content.

Its leaves spread out like a giant banana fan, making it a large specimen among herbaceous plants.\nThe traveler's palm, native to the African island nation of Madagascar, is a beloved and revered \"national tree\" of the Madagascan people. Despite being called a tree, it is a genuine herbaceous plant. The traveler's palm is \"sturdily built,\" reaching about 20 meters in height. Its leaves are both thick and long, generally reaching 3 to 4 meters. All the leaves are concentrated at the top of the stem, arranged symmetrically and evenly on both sides, forming a flat surface, resembling a giant folding fan rising from the ground, much like a peacock displaying its feathers, very beautiful.\nThe name \"traveler's palm\" is related to its characteristics. The large leaves of the traveler's palm can store water. Rainwater flows down the petiole into the petiole groove, and the broad, tightly packed lower part of the petiole is seamless and watertight. In emergencies, travelers can use a knife to pierce the bottom of the petiole to obtain water, hence it is known as the \"drinking station in the desert.\" The traveler's palm gets its name from this and is also called the \"traveler's tree,\" \"water tree,\" \"desert oasis,\" and \"life-saving tree.\"\nBased on the image content, judge the relevance of the query to the content.

The production of garlic in Acheng District dates back to 1115, when the Jurchen leader Wanyan Aguda established the Great Jin Empire and made the present-day Baicheng Village on the banks of the Ashi River its capital, historically known as 'Jin Shangjing Huining Prefecture,' which lasted through 4 emperors and 38 years. Among the crop varieties planted, garlic was the main one, boasting a history of 900 years. In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), the planting area of Acheng garlic reached 1300 mu. Acheng garlic is infused with a rich Jin Dynasty culture. Especially the garlic planted in the ruins of Jin Shangjing is filled with historical legends. Not to mention the folklore that Acheng garlic can be used as an antiseptic, nor that the founding emperor of the Jin Dynasty ate several heads of purple-skinned garlic every day, nor that a commoner once offered a sack of garlic in tribute and received a sack of gold in return. Just planting garlic within the imperial city ruins is enough to enhance the historical and cultural atmosphere of Acheng garlic. In 1996, Acheng was named 'Home of Garlic in Northern China' by the China Special Products Association.\nCombine the image content to judge the relevance of the query to the content.

I went to Qianhai Sam's to pick them up at noon after work, thinking that since they were pre-ordered and the time was set, I should be able to take them away upon arrival.

I carefully drove back to the school, and the parent representative seamlessly took over, adding decorations, making it look beautiful~!
