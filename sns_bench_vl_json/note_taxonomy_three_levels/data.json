Truly Amazing\nArticle Content: The minimalist bathroom paired with the vancoco Xingyue smart toilet featuring a hidden tank directly boosts the bathroom's aesthetics by N times. Moreover, it enhances the happiness of using the toilet.\n.\n🍃 More Hygienic with Female Cleaning Function\nMost smart toilets have built-in filters, but they generally only filter out large particles like rust. Installing an external filter to purify the water is more effective and easy to replace.\n.\n🍃 Safer with IPX4 Waterproof Rating\nEspecially in bathrooms where dry and wet areas are not completely separated, appliances like smart toilets must have a high waterproof rating.\n.\n🍃 More Comfortable with Heated Seat in Winter\nStarting from October, the weather turns cooler. Using a heated seat instead of a toilet cushion is more comfortable, and it even has three temperature adjustment levels, better fitting the sensory experience of a family of three.\n.\n🍃 More Convenient with Multiple Sensing Methods\nIn addition to automatic sensing, the foot-kick flip feature can recognize male urination, so the men in the house won't forget to flip the seat or flush.\n.\n🍃 Don't Forget Some Preparations for Installing a Smart Toilet!\n🐾 Pre-arrange the power outlet, not directly behind the toilet\n🐾 Measure the pit distance, clarify whether it's 305mm or 400mm\n🐾 Measure the water pressure, for a tankless smart toilet, the water pressure must meet the standard\n  Image source @Designer Coco, authorized#\nBased on the image, provide the article's three progressive classification categories.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

As for the other 6D, 9D, 10D, 99D, these are just names given by merchants to stimulate consumption, and it does not mean that the higher the D, the better the product. 2.5D is what everyone calls the large curved edge, and 3D adds a bottom curve to the 2.5D large curved edge. Many people don't know what the bottom curve is; our phone edges are all R-shaped corners, which is what everyone calls the large curved edge. If it were a right angle, the edge would feel sharp to the touch.\nEach product has its corresponding target audience. Transparent films are more commonly used in European and American countries because their phone cases are heavily wrapped, making them unsuitable for 2.5D and 3D. In China, 2.5D and 3D are more common, and you choose the film based on your case. If the case covers up to the black edge of the screen, you should use a 2.5D or transparent film. Using a 3D film would result in the film lifting. If the case only covers up to a little above the metal frame and not the screen, you can use a 3D film. Apple's original case can use a 3D film, but you need to buy one with good fit or a reduced 3D film to avoid lifting. If you use a bare phone without a case, you need to choose a true 3D full-coverage film because it won't shatter even if dropped, and of course, the smoothness of the feel cannot be ignored, as it will affect your experience.\nHere, I recommend a sapphire crystal-coated film, as shown in the image, with almost no white edges and no air bubbles. If the technique is not good, there might be some, so be sure to check the film application guide. Then there's the touch feel, which does not affect fingerprint unlocking at all. The fingerprint oil is very durable, so the feel is also good.\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

The price is also very reasonable, ranging from £6.5 to £9.5 per pack (250 grams), not as pretentious as some prices in China😬, which is really a bargain for us who need at least one cup a day. There is also a Decaffeinated option, which I rarely drink, but it’s great for satisfying cravings when I want a cup at night but am afraid of not being able to sleep. Looking forward to visiting their store in person after the lockdown ends. You can buy the beans directly from their official website, and generally, you can receive them within about three working days after placing an order. Friends living in London can also choose to pick them up themselves.\nCombine the image to give the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A. Food B.

Made to order, the crust is super crispy, crumbling at a touch, so you need to take a big bite! This way, you can taste all five layers of filling: scrambled egg, butter, cheese, luncheon meat, tomato… So satisfying, it's practically a 🍔\n🔹Melancholic Soul Rice❗️\nThe essence of this bowl of rice lies in its 🍚rice! Thai fragrant rice is just too amazing😘 I could eat its rice plain😋! 🥓The char siu is also cut thick and meaty, with a rich sauce underneath paired with a half-cooked runny egg, one bite is super satisfying!\n🔹Minhua Four Treasures Rice❗️\nIf you want more toppings, you can order this😬! One bowl of rice lets you taste wings, char siu, luncheon meat! Same Thai fragrant rice with honey sauce~\n🔖Regular Dishes👀\nThe other dishes are just average, the wings are a bit greasy, one bite and I'm already full… The crust of the egg tart is too hard, it almost punctured the inside of my mouth😂 The new Shrimp Toast is also greasy, and the drinks are nothing special, the Iced Lemon Tea is a bit astringent[poorR], maybe I'm not used to the authentic taste!\n🚥Environment\nThe retro style is great for photo-taking, you can also ask the waiter for their special newspaper to take photos~\nOverall, it's still worth checking out, but be sure to[cover faceR] avoid the pitfalls! Those signature dishes are still pretty good😍\n🔹Shop Name: Minhua Ice Room\n📍Address: Raffles/Dayangguang\nCombine the image to provide three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

I think it's more appropriate to call it a meat sausage, it's really too conscientious👏👏👏. Don't even mention eating it; just looking at it feels great. Although there are only four sausages in a bag, the portion is substantial. Mainly, the color of the meat looks very healthy, so I picked up my camera and started shooting. 📸📸📸\n🔑🔑🔑The moment I opened the packaging bag, more than a dozen ways to eat the sausage instantly popped into my mind: steaming, stir-frying, pan-frying, grilling, hot pot, it's really versatile, appetizing, and essential for drinking. Even the simplest home-style stir-fry method tastes delicious, the kids were crying with envy, and I didn't even spare any for them to eat.

After 21 days, the nucleic acid result will turn to a green code.\n🍀\nSince quarantine measures are being intensified everywhere, some places are 14+7, others are 14+14. Policies have just been revised and are somewhat chaotic in implementation. To avoid being unfairly intensified, I suggest everyone stay in Shanghai for 21 or 28 days before returning to their destination.\nTaking myself as an example, the quarantine policy in Guangdong is 14+7.\nAfter completing 14 days of quarantine in Shanghai, I stayed for an additional 3 days and also called the disease control center to confirm. I continued for 4 days in Guangdong until I reached 21 days of entry.\nBut when I arrived at the community, the sampling doctor asked me to continue home quarantine for 7 days. My quarantine turned into 14+11 [facepalmR][facepalmR][facepalmR]\nSo, if your entry city is not your destination, either leave immediately after centralized quarantine, or stay in Shanghai for a full 21 or 28 days before heading to your destination, which will be more convenient.\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

However, on the day itself, it turned out to be a sunny day, so the plan became:\nWake up naturally, have lunch, and then went to do pottery [Quyi Pottery Studio (I think that's the name)]. Since I had never tried it before, the experience was quite good, except for my shoes, which were covered in mud spots.\nAfter finishing pottery for about two hours, since I had bought a night ticket for the Oriental Landscape Water Park, I went back to the hotel and rested for about an hour [crying laugh R][crying laugh R][crying laugh R].\nNight ticket 💰100+, entered the park at 4:30 PM and it closed at 9:30 PM. During this time, I played five attractions. The biggest regret was that there was no fireworks show during the Dragon Boat Festival. A gentle reminder❗If you take a taxi to the park, it's really hard to get a taxi when leaving the park!!

It doesn't ask for food, just drinks some water at the door and says hello, then lies down with its back to me: You do your thing, I have my own business to attend to.\nBesides live streaming for business, Tempura's daily job is mainly to guard its territory. Recently, the big-tailed fox comes every day. Although it doesn't get any food, it spends a lot of time marking and sniffing around the yard, making Tempura uneasy, so it has to come to the yard to watch for the enemy around the same time every day.\nHe doesn't move, and gradually the sensor light goes out (by the way, when the light is off, Wally can't see him [laughing cry R] the dogs' eyes are indeed just for show). Sometimes when I come back after finishing my own business, I find him still there, a small figure casting a long shadow in the dark, a fluffy little head showing seriousness and dedication.\nWhen he hears me coming to the door to look at him, he, like in Picture Three, doesn't get up, just turns his head to look at me. Finding that I have nothing to ask him, he turns his head back to continue staring at the back door seriously. His two black little ears, like small radars, keep turning. The movements of the entire yard are under his control.\nTonight, after being on duty for over half an hour here, perhaps because he heard some noise behind, he suddenly got up and quietly ran into the night without even saying goodbye.\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

We went during the peak season, didn't choose self-driving, and found a travel group to charter a car and customize our itinerary. We arranged our own meals and accommodation. Originally planned for 10 days, but had to leave 4 days early due to some matters, which was too too too too regrettable!!!\n1⃣️ Urumqi: Grand Bazaar, Min Street\n2⃣️ Urumqi➡️ Wucai Beach (staying in Burqin), personally I think Wucai Beach is really mediocre, and very small, with just a few viewing platforms, you can see everything in one glance. We went during the day and left after five minutes. Online says it's best to go at sunset when it's most beautiful. At night, you must go for a walk in Burqin and watch the sunset, which is more beautiful than Wucai Beach.\n3⃣️ Burqin➡️ Hemu (staying in Hemu Scenic Area), Hemu is totally worth it, but you must book the hotel in advance. Price increase during peak season is a minor issue, but the accommodation inside is extremely tight. The food inside the scenic area is quite expensive, but you can see the Milky Way and shooting stars at night! It's a bit cold watching shooting stars outside, so be sure to have a down jacket ready! (The starry sky in Hemu can't be captured with a phone camera and shooting stars)\n4⃣️ Hemu➡️ Kanas (staying in Jiadengyu), since we stayed inside the scenic area in Hemu, we chose to stay outside for Kanas. Many attractions were under maintenance when we went, so we only went to the lake. There was a staircase we didn't go up, reportedly takes an hour to climb. After visiting the lake, we took a direct bus back to the scenic area entrance. On the way back, we encountered attractions where the driver gave us five to ten minutes to get off and look. In Jiadengyu, we stayed in a Mongolian yurt in some residential area, and there was a bonfire party at night which was great, and the yurt was also very warm.\n5⃣️ Jiadengyu➡️ Devil City (staying in Karamay City), Devil City is really hot, so hot that we bought ice cream immediately after taking photos to cool down. Be sure to do a good job of sun protection.\n6⃣️ Karamay➡️ Sayram Lake (staying at Sayram Lake), we were supposed to visit Sayram Lake, but I had to return due to some matters, so the rest of the journey had to be completed by my friends. When going to Sayram Lake, do not stay in the Mongolian yurts by the lake, there are no toilets, and there's only one tap outside for washing your face, the conditions are too harsh.\n7⃣️ Sayram Lake➡️ Narat (staying in Narat Town)\n8⃣️ Narat➡️ Duku Highway (staying in Urumqi)\n9⃣️ Urumqi➡️ Shanshan Desert (staying in Urumqi)\n🔟 The tenth day is the return journey.\nWhen buying specialties, I directly searched for the store on Xiaohongshu and the Grand Bazaar. Don't think the things at the Grand Bazaar are expensive, as long as you know how to bargain, everything is not a problem [smiling face with horns R].\nBased on the image, provide three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 options: A.

Started with a 5-minute warm-up by MadFit, then followed by Heather's fusion training. I love this kind of fusion training. This one combines with Tabata training, 20s on 10s off. The difference from HIIT is the way it stimulates the heart rate. Tabata, overall, is a more efficient and higher intensity training method. [Thumbs Up R]\n----\n🎈Key Points:\n1. Includes warm-up and stretching, about 25 minutes in total. There are 5 circuit sets, each with 2 movements repeated 4 times. You can choose light weights or bodyweight. I chose 2kg dumbbells and needed a yoga mat. [Wink R]\n2. The movements themselves are not difficult. The challenge is more on the heart rate, which in other words, is how much fat it can burn. The average heart rate for the 25-minute workout was 152, with a maximum of 169, and calorie consumption was 260kcal, for reference. [Thumbs Up R]\n3. Coordination between upper and lower body needs attention + core tightening for the best results. Includes basic movements like kicking, squats, boxing, etc., and different combinations. However, there's no progress bar in the video, so you don't know how much is left to complete, which is a downside. [Disappointed R]\n----\n🎈Summary:\nI really enjoy this set! It's truly efficient. As long as you warm up properly, it's not too hard and actually feels like a morning wake-up call. I believe it would also have a good sweat effect if done in the afternoon. [Grin R]\n\nWishing everyone a pleasant workout! [Blush R] @SportsPotato\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

It was my first time visiting after all these years. The venue is huge, with various trampolines and small games for kids at the entrance. The maze is divided into phase 1 and phase 2; we only did the simpler phase 1 and almost got lost inside, wandering in circles 😂. Fortunately, it wasn't particularly hot on Saturday, and we slowly found our way out following the prompts. There's also a small farm nearby with various animals. For 25 cents, you can buy some feed to feed the lambs, but we didn't get a chance since we couldn't compete with a bunch of kids. My favorite was the large sunflower field, where every photo turned out great 🌻, and you can pick your own sunflowers for a dollar each.

Don't buy it!\nThe rest of the steps are exactly the same as for green pepper stir-fried with meat!\n\nThe braised tofu was made with a sweet flavor, using medium-firm tofu.\nIt's between firm and soft tofu, and it's especially delicious when fried!\nThe steps are also very simple:\n1. Fry the tofu in a flat pan until fragrant, then drain the oil.\n2. Use a small amount of oil in the pan to sauté ginger and garlic (I didn't have ginger, so I only used garlic, and it was still tasty).\n3. Add the tofu and the soul sauce: sugar (a little more is fine) + light soy sauce + dark soy sauce + oyster sauce.\n4. Add a small amount of water and simmer for a bit, then thicken with cornstarch water, and sprinkle with green onions before serving.\n\nThese two dishes really have a homely taste, and every time I make such stir-fries, it feels like I've traveled thousands of miles back home, with the sound of my mom urging me to eat from the kitchen, very happy [BlushingR].\nI will always love Chinese stir-fries!\nCombine the image to give the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

It feels like wearing a cloud, really too soft! Will keep buying more in the future!\n\nUpdate note:\nThis was my first time buying a cashmere sweater, it's from the Pipidog brand, purchased directly from their TB flagship store. I chose this brand mainly because everyone says it's an old Shanghai brand that sells well in physical stores.\nThe purple one is the thickest, weighing 330g; the gray turtleneck is 220g, and the semi-turtleneck is 280g, for everyone's reference on the weight. I bought all in size L, comfortable to wear, not tight.\nHeight 162cm, weight 110lbs, bought size L, otherwise the sleeves would be short, for everyone's reference.\nDuring the Double Eleven sale, with 30% off on three items + large coupons + full reduction + 88VIP 95% off + recharge shopping gold + consumption vouchers, the final price for the gray one was less than 200, and the purple one was close to 300. I am very satisfied with getting such comfortable pure cashmere sweaters at this price!\nI bought a total of 7 pieces, the family photo is in the last picture, everyone can take a look (the indoor lighting is a bit dark, the photos don't look very good, but the actual colors are all very nice).\nCombine the image to provide three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 options: A.

The Architecture School seems to be closed, so students order in the group chat, and the auntie prepares the food while the uncle delivers it to the door.\n🌸\nIn the middle, the auntie suddenly became very anxious because a student wanted to place an order, but she forgot what he wanted to eat. She also wasn't very good at using a smartphone. She came over to ask me how to add this student. I saw that they were already friends, so I told her to just use voice calls. I taught her for a while before she understood how to make a call, but I'm not sure if she fully understood.\n🙊\nThe auntie seems to be illiterate and her Mandarin is not very standard. In the future, when ordering, it's best to keep it simple, clearly writing down what you want in text, like: Corn + Meat one serving, Beans and Meat one serving. If the request is complex, it's better to call directly because they might not understand [Facepalm R].

The wooden cabin, the snowy ground, the dark forest, and the silhouettes of the couple created a scene full of storytelling. I quickly raised my camera to capture this moment.\n\nThis winter, my handmade speaker from the Year of Tableware broke, so I customized a Rube Yang Bluetooth speaker with excellent sound quality and a customizable panel. I chose the photo of the couple in the snow country I took that year as the panel, making it uniquely mine. The day after the speaker arrived, the first snow of the winter fell here, as if everything was arranged.\n\nThe snow continued to fall, gradually covering the familiar scenery with white, making it distant and unfamiliar. I sat under the pergola on the terrace, roasting fire, brewing tea, watching the snow, and listening to music with my new speaker. Although I was sitting at home, my heart was filled with a sense of wandering, primeval vastness, and freedom. I like this feeling, just as I enjoy beautiful images, pure music, and all blessed love.\n\nWhat in the world can make the most ordinary scene suddenly filled with meaning?\nMusic, snow, and the beloved.\n\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 options: A.

That's Anandi!\n\nThinking that today's check-out would go smoothly. Who knew they would call at 11:30 AM to rush the check-out! Unbelievable! Lazy with check-in, but rush you to death for check-out! Who would think it gets even worse! Probably seeing no response from us, someone came knocking, saying it's housekeeping. At that time, I was busy packing and didn't open the door in time, only to hear the sound of a key card swiping and the door opening with a click, a guy's head popped in. I hurried over to ask what was up, and he asked if I had any laundry? Exo Me? Moreover, he had a string of master keys in his hand, and there was no housekeeping cart behind him, so what kind of housekeeping are you?\n\nFirstly, I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light on, yet they still barged in.\nSecondly, doesn't the front desk know today's check-out? Why are you asking if there's anything to wash? Isn't this intentional? Besides, I didn't call the front desk to say I had laundry.\nThirdly, if I had been in the bathroom at that time, with the staff ignoring the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and still using a master key to open the door, how could the guest's personal privacy be guaranteed?\n\nAt this point, I think the previous issues are no longer just individual staff problems, but rather that this hotel lacks the most basic professional training and staff quality.\n\nWhat high-end, what luxury, what wellness. It's just that you pay the money, eat 💩, and still have to be Zen, and promote that 💩 is fragrant and can improve health! Having money to buy press releases, hiring influencers for promotion, keeping two peacocks to become an influencer check-in spot, why not first see what you really are!\n\n@Shanghai Anandi Hotel @Shanghai Anandi Hotel Management Co., Ltd @ANANDI Shanghai Anandi Hotel\n\n\nBased on the image, provide the article's three progressive classification categories.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

On February 3rd, I discovered that the Beijing Health Kit pop-up window restricted the purchase of train tickets to Beijing. I took nucleic acid tests for three consecutive days, called Beijing's 12345 and 12320 to report and register my information, but the pop-up window has not disappeared yet.\n🟡 On February 7th, I bought a train ticket to Langfang. Upon exiting the station, scanning my ID would trigger an alarm, requiring me to show Hebei's health code (available on Alipay) and the travel itinerary card (mini program) to exit.\n🟡 In Langfang, I arranged for friends from Beijing to pick me up. When passing through the Yingsi checkpoint, scanning my ID triggered an alarm. The police took my ID and the vehicle's driving permit, instructing me to register at the window of a white house. I waited for about an hour, during which my nucleic acid test was checked, I was asked which district I came from, and then I contacted the receiving unit/community (I directly called my unit leader). I successfully retrieved my ID and driving permit.\n🟡 In summary, currently, the Health Kit pop-up window only allows entry into Beijing by car. According to my friend who picked me up, the Yingsi checkpoint is relatively easy to pass through. It is crucial to contact in advance, whether it's the unit or the community. The checkpoint staff are also very understanding. Let's be polite in our speech; it's a cold day, and everyone is having a tough time, right? hhhh\n🟡 That's about it. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message. Wishing everyone a smooth return to Beijing [WowR][WowR]. I'll provide further feedback on resolving the Health Kit pop-up window issue at the community level.\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

Then, it was Barbie Q [embarrassed R]—besides buying a set of 6 for the Winter Paralympics opening ceremony, the other two sets were sold out. I was practically furious at my own stupidity [crying R][frustrated R][frustrated R].\nThen, I kept refreshing and finally managed to get a complete set of Bing Dwen Dwen commemorative envelopes for self-pickup by noon.\nBut it was hard to get Shuey Rhon Rhon, especially for self-pickup. First, I used my Apple phone to grab two mailed ones, then got three self-pickup ones, and after that, I basically couldn't get any more.

I hope I can get a complete set of Shuey Rhon Rhon at that time [pitiful R].\nLittle TIPS: If you reach the interface in Figure 3, it means you are one step away from being able to buy tickets.

As a newbie who had just joined, I thought I was about to make a sale [Disdain R]. But then I wondered why they would contact me via Alipay, which seemed strange. They didn't ask about the product and placed an order directly, sending a very blurry picture and asking me to find customer service on WeChat. They even threatened to sue me for compensation of over 9,000 yuan due to delayed communication with the customer service. Fortunately, I remained calm in the face of this issue [Sigh R] and contacted Xianyu customer service. However, the customer service didn't respond to me, despite calling several times [Sigh R]. Feeling helpless, I didn't know what to do and searched on Baidu, looking at Xianyu newbie forums and the like. It took nearly an hour to resolve the matter. I haven't been scammed by her yet, and I hope newbies joining Xianyu pay attention to these details‼️ Be vigilant against scams and don't lose big for small gains.

My philosophy is to play with clothes in different ways to find unique value. In this fast-paced era, everything changes too quickly, and all values are fleeting. But beauty is eternal, it radiates from within, and clothing is precisely a great complementary item that makes everything more vivid and interesting. Clothing should never be the backbone of temperament, but styling will enhance your beauty even more.\n\nExtravagance | For me, dressing is an attitude to convey my emotions, as well as my expectations and aspirations for life. I have always admired extravagant dressing, like a special perfume, you may not own it, but you definitely want to experience its scent. Extravagance is also another attitude towards clothing and life, passionate and free.\n\nFinally, I wish all the little fairies can achieve their dreams and create their own beauty without being bound by rules.\nWelcome fairies to find me at Westfield, located opposite Myer Lululemon.\nStore Name: Freya | JoJo Boutique\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

But you can try the same method on Tuesday and Wednesday too~ Just note that the special deals vary.\n1. As long as your Alipay and WeChat are registered with the same phone number and you are a member, they can be interconnected. A feature of the Burger King Alipay mini-program is that coupons can be stacked, regardless of how you obtained them, they do not affect each other.\n2. So, first collect 3 coupons each from your WeChat Burger King mini-program and Alipay Burger King mini-program. (Burger King is celebrating its anniversary this month with different special deals every day, and Monday is 1 yuan for Szechuan Pepper Chicken Leg). This way, you have 6 coupons for 1 yuan Szechuan Pepper Chicken Legs!\n3. Since the chicken leg coupon requires an additional purchase of 10 yuan, you need to pair it with other snacks. For example, I have 5 yuan chicken nuggets that I can add to the cart. (Of course, those few-yuan fries you bought on Koubei can also be used. Any coupons you can see in your account can be stacked. If not, search for \"Burger King\" on Alipay on the spot, and you'll find some special deals).\n4. Add all 6 chicken leg coupons and a chicken nugget coupon to the cart, and you can place your order, isn't it satisfying? (When ordering through the Alipay mini-program, I found that it recognized three of the chicken leg coupons as my additional purchase. So, adding a 5 yuan chicken nugget was enough. Otherwise, I would still need to buy 10 yuan worth of items).\n5. Other lucky coupons: You can get a free small fries for each purchase if you leave a thoughtful review! You can also add it to your order. Recently, scrolling down the Alipay consumption voucher page, you can also get a 1 yuan Mini Whopper (usable with additional consumption).\n6. Don't forget! Paying with Alipay at Burger King can get you an additional 2 yuan discount with Hangzhou consumption vouchers!!\n\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 options: A.

You'll regret it if you miss out!\n-\n✨Name: Large-scale immersive script murder ~ Yangcheng Past\n✨Let me tell you how much I love this script murder. When it comes to immersion, it's all about being there in person, and the organizers have done a great job with this. First of all 🎥 in terms of the 'Scene', the location is in Guangzhou's Fashion Tianhe ~ Shanghai Street, which has a strong Republican era vibe. Even if it's not for script murder, just coming here to take photos and eat is quite 🉑.\n👗 'Costumes' (arrive half an hour early) there are quite a few styles for girls to choose from, including cute qipaos and very stylish qipaos, not to mention the Republican student uniforms (which make you look super young [shyR]). For guys, it's Zhongshan suits and mandarin jackets. Sizes range from s-xl, so arrive early, as it's not as fun if you can't find a size and can't change into a costume.\n🪙 'Props' include a cloth bag + 2 silver dollars + task cards. Players can exchange tasks for silver dollars to unlock the plot.\n💃🏼 'NPCs' number 8 people. Their acting is quite good. Get tasks from NPCs to earn money and understand the plot, advancing the script. NPC tasks are interconnected, so it's recommended to chat with them more.\n-\n✨Content: The script is set against the backdrop of the Republican era, experiencing the turmoil of the times, searching for evidence on-site as ordinary people, exploring the identity of underground party members, and experiencing their work.\n-\n✨Purchase method: WeChat Cat's Eye Movie Performance mini-program, search 🔍 Yangcheng Past, there will be 3 scripts, see which one you want to play, different scripts have different locations.\n-\n✨Number of people: No limit, 🉑 go alone, or 🉑 in groups\n✨Sessions: 13:00 and 16:00 (arrive half an hour early to change costumes)\n✨Duration: 2 hours (with a half-hour debriefing after the end)\n✨Price: 158~188💰 different themes have different prices\nPS: No matter how many friends you bring, it's recommended to form groups of 2~3 for ease of movement and unlocking the plot. Of course, it's also great for couples to go play. Too many people in a group can be less fun (purely personal advice). Overall, for a script murder at this price point, the cost-performance ratio is very high!

Recently, after getting this set of kitchen gadgets, I realized that I can also be 'orderly'~\n🌈\nTaking advantage of the weekend to buy groceries, wash and cut them, and using the new tools, I can prepare almost a week's worth of side dishes in less than 2 hours, significantly reducing kitchen cooking time~\n🌈\nEveryone should be familiar with the brand Zwilling J.A. Henckels, their kitchen knives are so renowned. This time, I got their vacuum preservation set. The wireless vacuum machine is truly advanced, saving a lot of effort; just press a button and wait 10 seconds for the operation to complete! And it's very quiet~\n🌈\nThe storage boxes/bags are all BPA-free and can be used in refrigerators, microwaves, and dishwashers. Each storage box/bag has a QR code on its surface; scanning it leads to a corresponding APP where you can record the food storage time.\n🌈\nA reminder to everyone: do not compress soft and juicy foods, I compressed tomatoes and they turned to mush [DisappointedR][DisappointedR][DisappointedR]\n@LittlePotato @FoodiePotato\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

It must be due to the light fermentation of glutinous rice and yuzu. The ingredient list is very clean, only rice and fresh fruit, completely burden-free to drink.

Even wanting a Daliyuan is a luxury (because I actually don't really like bread with fillings, as most of them are not very tasty). Previously, when I was counting supplies, I wanted to try something new. After ordering the Snow Stick and taking the first bite, it completely broke my defenses [Disappointed R]. Later, the situation became increasingly difficult, and every day's breakfast turned into Snow Sticks. 10 days of breakfast, 10 days of Snow Sticks, it was really unbearable. But later, maybe out of habit, I suddenly found that the Snow Stick with the center removed was quite tasty. I ended up eating it for nearly half a month, sometimes even two sticks a day [Shy R]. I wasn't very resistant to it anymore. But today, the counselor suddenly said that since most students don't like Snow Sticks, they have already feedback to the manufacturer, and there won't be any more Snow Sticks from tomorrow. I don't know why, but I suddenly felt a bit sad. I actually cried for it [Facepalm R]. Because I suddenly thought that maybe, as a piece of bread, it also wants to be liked, to be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn't want to be disliked either. And actually, its taste isn't that bad. It's just that when we have many choices, we definitely won't choose it. But fortunately, because of this pandemic, it has appeared in everyone's vision and has gained the love of some students, including me, who has grown fond of it over time, hhh. It's quite good. I feel like I will always remember this little bread, because it seems rare to have such an unfavorable time in life. It's not just a little bread, but also a companion that has helped everyone through the difficult times of the pandemic. Everyone can freely vent their unhappy emotions through it. So, why can't it be a kind little bread? I hope that after the lockdown is lifted, I will occasionally go to the store and buy a \"Snow Stick\" to eat. Of course, I will [Thumbs Up R].\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A. Food B. Travel C. Entertainment D.

It feels quite ceremonial and therapeutic to take a photo of each meal after receiving it. The quarantine routine is pretty much the same for everyone: three meals a day hung on the doorknob, with a knock to remind me. Breakfast at 7:30 AM, lunch at 11:30 AM, and dinner at 6:30 PM. The food is generally good, except for being a bit oily. At 9 AM and 3 PM every day, the front desk calls to check my temperature. Thermometers are already provided in the room.\nOn the afternoon of the first day of quarantine, the hotel called to inform us that the quarantine would be lifted at 2 PM on the 19th. They asked whether we would return home by train or plane, and mentioned that there would be a dedicated bus to take us to the train station or airport, implying that we are not allowed to stay and visit Nanjing.\nOn the second day of quarantine, I received a call from the Qiaoxi District Street Office in Shijiazhuang, asking which country I returned from and where I was quarantining. They informed me that after returning home, I would still need to undergo 7 days of community centralized quarantine followed by 7 days of home quarantine.\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

Now, after using it for half a year, I really feel that Samsung is just too amazing![ShyR]\nLet's start with the advantages:\nThe transparent and dynamic artistic design makes the living room space less dull and monotonous. Whether it's a small apartment or a villa, this TV can easily blend in. Bluetooth connectivity for playing music is also very convenient, and it is compatible with most phones (not necessarily a Samsung phone).\nThe Ambient Screen is super beautiful, making the entire TV look like a painting, transforming this cold home appliance into a warm piece of art.\nOf course, it also has some disadvantages:\nFor those who particularly enjoy large screens and the home theater experience, it's not the best choice. Currently, the largest size for The Serif TV is only 55 inches. However, for someone like me who only uses the TV for entertainment and casual video and TV show watching, Samsung is just perfect!\n——Content reproduced from Xiaohongshu blogger: imashleyyao\n⭐\nWant to let more people see your quality life?\nCome and post notes, showcase your Samsung appliances, and share your home design and usage experience [LikeR]! Be sure to include the topic #PlantingGrassSamsungAppliances and @SamsungAppliances!\nExcellent notes will be reposted to the official Samsung Appliances Xiaohongshu account, letting more people see your aesthetic [PartyR].

Non-local Travel Eating Guide\nArticle Content: Recently, I've seen many posts saying that traveling to Changsha is ineffective, with crowds everywhere queuing up and unable to eat, leaving a bad impression, which is very frustrating. Changsha is actually a happy and leisurely city! First of all, I'm not a native of Changsha, I only visit once a year as a tourist. My husband's family has lived in Wu Yi Square for twenty years, and my in-laws often frequent various restaurants [laughing cry R]. If you also choose to stay near Wu Yi Square/Huang Xing Street (this area is indeed the most convenient for travel), you can check out my recommendations:\n1. Noodle Shops: Changsha people start their morning with a bowl of noodles. Gongjiao Xincun Noodle Shop is well-known, but if you're staying near the pedestrian street, you can go to Zhouji Noodle Shop or Si Jie Noodle Shop, both are delicious and not crowded. Besides noodles, you can also have scallion oil cake and sugar oil cake in the morning, personally, anything freshly made is tasty [adorable R].\n2. Hunan Cuisine: Hunan cuisine varies from person to person. If you are a tourist who just wants to try Hunan cuisine and values the dining environment, you can try Xiang Jueshi on the top floor of IFS, which I visit every year in Changsha [blowing a kiss R], and you don't need to queue if you go a bit earlier. If you want to find the most authentic taste in a small local restaurant, I recommend Xiang Yuanzi Private Cuisine, where you can eat as soon as you arrive.\n3. Flavored Shrimp: Wenheyou's flavored shrimp is expensive and crowded, you can try Tai Xiangkoufu in Sifangping, a food stall where you almost don't need to wait, just find your own seat.\n4. Milk Tea: Chayan Yuese is a must-visit internet-famous shop [laughing cry R], and you can also choose Ningji, Guizi Lemon Tea is a specialty, reportedly adding a type of mountain pepper oil used in betel nuts.\n5. Barbecue: Mengzhong really isn't good. Previously, I loved Kechuan Chupin, where you can directly order Hei Se Jing Dian without queuing at the pedestrian street. Since my favorite sweet mini pineapple was discontinued, I choose to go to Benben BBQ! It used to be a food stall, now it's a large store with a decent environment!\n6. Foot Massage: After a day of running around, you must end your day with a massage, just find a nearby Yi Erkang! Their simple yet effective massage techniques will let you go back to sleep comfortably!\n7. Pastry Shops: Forgot to mention this, Mo Mo is really popular now, but I tried it and didn't buy it, isn't this just a more expensive alternative to Sam's [embarrassed R]?\nI'll update tomorrow after visiting Hutouju's cake roll, and last time when passing by Guojin, I saw a very attractive tart shop, perfect for photo-taking!\nOnce again, tastes vary from person to person! This is a non-native's summary of a check-in guide!

I've bought some that were extremely salty [Embarrassed R] but fast food is convenient, just pop it in the air fryer and it's ready to eat quickly. I recommend the one in the picture, I only tried it yesterday, and you'll know how delicious it is once you try it. The saltiness is just right, and the chicken inside is flavorful, not too dry. Although it has nothing to do with Korean fried chicken, this fried chicken itself is still very tasty [Chomp R][Chomp R]\n🍋 Finally tried the internet celebrity donuts Mamas Donuts, their opening hours are short, only 4 days a week, and they often sell out. Last time I passed by during a walk and found them open, but since I went late, there weren't many types of donuts left, so I bought 6. Not very recommended, extremely sweet, the kind of sweetness locals love [Laughing Cry R]. The girl selling the donuts kept sprinkling sugar frosting on them for a better appearance, and the first bite was a shock to my teeth (really, not exaggerating). But if you can handle this level of sweetness, their flavors are quite good, especially the peanut flavor. My top choice is still the donuts from Queenstown, the refreshing type among donuts.\n🍋 The lemon tea from Pavilion Tea that was sold out instantly is very tasty, sour and refreshing, even better with some ice added.\n\n@Foodie Potato\n\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

The efficiency is very high, probably a survival skill forced out by New York.\n·\n[Wow R] [Matcha Pearl Fresh Milk with Strawberry] I don't know what this fancy name means, but it's a layered matcha milk tea with strawberry pearls. The fresh milk is rich and fragrant, the matcha is pure and not bitter, the tea flavor is just right, and the strawberry pearls have only a light strawberry taste. Personally, I prefer it as it doesn't have an overwhelming taste of sugar. The texture is very fresh, bouncy, and soft, very balanced. As shown in the picture, this cup costs seven dollars with tax, high-quality and affordable.\n·\nIn comparison, it feels really hard to find innovative, unique, and quality-controlled bubble tea in Boston.

But for the baby in the belly, one still needs to get up and prepare some nutritious meal to fill the stomach.\n🌈 Today, let's make a simple and delicious green vegetable and shredded pork noodles, with noodles, vegetables, and soup, a bowl of noodles satisfies the so-called nutrition needs of a pregnant mom. The method is convenient: shred the pork and marinate with a little salt and light soy sauce, coat with a bit of cornstarch to make the shredded pork more tender. Only celery is available at home, so use what's on hand, cut the celery into sections. Heat oil in the pan, sauté the green onions until fragrant, add the shredded pork and stir-fry until cooked, then add the celery sections and stir-fry together, use whatever seasonings are available at home! Once the meat and vegetables are cooked, set them aside. Boil water in a pot, and when it boils, add the noodles. When the noodles are 80% cooked, pour the meat and vegetables into the pot, add seasonings to taste, and cook until done!\n🌈 Because the kitchen is too hot, a clever idea struck, using the newly acquired electric hot pot with a fan in the dining room while the air conditioner is on. Hahaha, how ingenious of me. The electric hot pot plugs directly into the power without needing an induction cooker or gas, plus with the air conditioner, it didn't feel hot while stir-frying, and with 700w power, it's energy-saving and fast, making this meal truly a delightful experience. Beautiful mood, satisfied appetite 👌🏻\n#Small Appliances That Enhance Happiness\nBased on the image, provide three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

As it turned out, the collaboration between Gucci and Balenciaga, The Hacker Project, was actually going to be released.\n\nThis artist is keen on playing word games, such as the graffiti outside the Hermès store, \"Love didn't meet her at her best, it met her in her mèss,\" which is a pun on the name Hermès.\n\nHe also added the phrase \"I hate summer\" to Moncler, a brand specializing in down products; wrote \"I hate social media\" outside the Bottega Veneta store that deleted its social media platforms early on; and graffitied \"My mama don't like you\" on the promotional photo of Justin Bieber for Balenciaga (a line from the song \"Love yourself\").\n\nSuch slogans have gradually made his creations popular memes online. He believes that the strategy of luxury fashion brands is to reach more people in the market, but these brands often lack the humor of ordinary people. By combining these two points, he popularizes luxury fashion brands as memes online, which is also a form of alternative promotion for the brands.\n\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

There are many parking lots to choose from, and if you are going to the lower fall and upper fall, it is better to choose the EAST CANYON Trail LOWER FALL GOLD CREEK pass.\n🌟🌟🌟Danger Warning: The first three pictures are taken standing at the top of the upper fall, where the water flow is very rapid and there is a cliff below. After jumping across, I found that I couldn't jump back the same way because it was too high (didn't dare to take the risk).

How do you define 'good'?\nFirst, it must be networked, allowing remote viewing via smartphone; second, it should be able to rotate in all directions for no-blind-spot monitoring; third, it must have a resolution of 2K or higher, ensuring clarity even when zoomed in. Based on these criteria, which products come to mind? How much do they cost?\n\nI found a highly cost-effective option: the XiaoBai Y2 Camera Premium Edition. It fully meets my requirements and even exceeds them. For instance, it offers 2.5K 4-megapixel image quality, which is much better than the standard 1080p; it features human motion tracking, deterring thieves effectively. Of course, it also supports TF card storage (up to 256GB), allowing direct playback on the phone, which is very convenient for evidence collection if needed.\nThe key point! It seamlessly integrates with the Mi Home APP, providing an excellent user experience, just like operating a remote control. Additionally, in terms of installation, it supports upside-down installation, allowing it to be hung from the ceiling for a wider and higher monitoring angle.\nWith such powerful performance, how much does it cost? 189! It's actually only 169 during promotions...

Didn't read much today, just a small, simple section.\n5⃣Teacher Qualification Subject 1 Study: Watched Fenbi's online course, spent the most time on this, got a general idea of what Subject 1 tests, and studied the educational perspective in Chapter 1, not very hard, but a lot to memorize, didn't buy a book, so writing down key points myself is a bit tiring.\n6⃣Watched “The Age of Awakening”: Really awesome! Highly recommend! I love Mr. Zhongfu, and learned a lot.\n\n🔝Today's Shortcomings:\nDidn't get up in the morning again, barely studied in the morning, so piled all study tasks into the afternoon, felt a bit overwhelmed, and the study time wasn't long, maybe not yet adapted to starting to study. Hope to wake up early in the future, and spend less time on the phone, still not disciplined enough, doing things just to complete tasks, this is not good, need to adjust the state 💓 take it slow, progress bit by bit is fine!\n\n🎶Met a lovely person while listening to music, goodnight [Sleeping R]\n\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

Who can predict whether tomorrow or an accident will come first? Who can be composed enough, neither sad nor happy, with a calm heart, to complete a final farewell?\n.\nThis special festival reminds us to cherish those who are connected to us, to cherish the time we spend together, and to cherish the rare encounters and relationships in life. What we have not cherished, we no longer possess.\n.\nIn a person's limited life, some people come and go, real yet illusory. In the end, apart from faint memories, it seems as if nothing ever happened.\n.\nA gust of wind, a tree in bloom, a drop of rain, life and death, separation, longing, cherishing—these images and emotions take on a more special significance during Qingming. Only by understanding the value and fragility of life can we experience the meaning of happiness in our daily lives.\n.\nThe deceased have passed, and the living carry on. In a lifetime, one must taste all the flavors of life; experience joy and sorrow, parting and reunion; witness life and death. By letting go of the present and turning towards the good, one can be reborn.\n.\n🌿 'All things will pass away, but love will turn into eternity.'\nBased on the image, provide the three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.

I lost about seven or eight pounds in six days and could barely stand. I felt that the way to the hospital with my dad might have been a moment of brief recovery. He held me up and walked briskly.\nI remembered a few years ago when I had mumps, my cheeks were swollen like utensils, and I had a high fever. I could only drink a little porridge every day. My dad, who didn't know which elder he heard from, said that applying cactus to the face could cure this disease. He dug up a cactus from outside, cut it in half, and asked me to apply it to my face. But I was feverish and slept soundly, so he had to use double-sided tape to wrap half a cactus on my head.\nIt's hard to say if it's more love or more torment 😄\nCombine the image to give three progressive classification categories for the article.\n\nCategory 1 Options: A.
