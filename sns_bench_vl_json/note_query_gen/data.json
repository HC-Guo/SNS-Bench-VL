Just in time, I saw another blogger's post on upcycling old clothes on Xiaohongshu. I was quickly intrigued. Wouldn't this save me money on buying new clothes? I felt so clever that I didn't hesitate to buy this haunek clothing dye. I originally thought the process wouldn't be very convenient, but it turned out to be so easy. The instructions are on the back of the bottle, hehe. Add the appropriate amount of dye according to the clothing, dissolve it in boiling water, and mix well. Then add it to water at 60-90¬∞C, add 2 spoonfuls of salt to speed up the dissolving and coloring process. Stir evenly several times in between, then soak for 20 minutes, and wash off the excess color (it's really great, the excess color disappears after two washes). After that, use a fixing agent to set the color, and once the fixing is done, rinse with clean water before hanging it up. In the morning, my white t-shirts turned into navy blue t-shirts. I'm so awesome! I absolutely love the haunek clothing dye!!! Its ingredients are also very safe, not harmful to clothes, not harmful to hands, and it doesn't stain your hands at all.

It's similar to Uniqlo's +J, which was not with the Jil Sander brand, but with Jil Sander herself, the founder of the brand, who had already left the Jil Sander brand.\n\nAnyway, this doesn't stop us from spending freely, right [Buy Burst R]\nA few days ago, I started seeing people on Xiaohongshu posting about it\nFinally made it to the weekend, only to find that many scents like Rhodes and Tempe are already sold out\nTo be safe, I went straight to the Ikea in Marsden Park, and the stock was quite complete. Except for the all-white bamboo peach scent, all other medium sizes were in stock. Some Xiaohongshu users said that restocking happens every morning until sold out, so interested ladies should hurry [Party R]\n\nü™îLet's talk about the scents first. Many people recommend Clove Amber. Honestly, it smells quite similar to other IKEA candle lines, and personally, I'm not a big fan.\n\nüö¨If you, like me, prefer more woody scents, such as Maison Margiela's 'by the fireplace', I strongly recommend Tobacco Honey and Wood Spice. They are very warm and healing.\n\nü™¥If you prefer fresher scents, Basil Mint, Pomegranate Amber, and Tea Verbena are very good choices. They are very subtle and natural.\nü™µThe Swedish Birch Juniper scent is also very unique, it has a way of bringing people back to their childhood.\n\nüïØThe burning time is 45 hours, made in Poland.\n\nüè∫Now, let's talk about this ceramic jar. It's just too cute, full of a fresh Japanese style.\nWith the backing of a professional perfumery brand, the price of $20 is quite reasonable.\n@IKEA Home\nOptions: A. papi recommended perfume B.

When shaping the figures in this painting, roughly follow the human body proportions: standing 7, sitting 5, and crouching 3.5. There is no need to depict the entire face, just use simple contour lines to summarize during the painting process. The clothing wrinkles are also mainly simplified, and when using the brush, you can start and end softly, paying a little attention to the overlapping relationship of the clothing wrinkles.\n2. When depicting the small figure in the right foreground, pay attention to his posture, which has a slightly reclining feel on the ground, with a slight tilt. Because it is a back view, the collar slightly covers the head.\n3. When painting the small stove, you can also just draw a simple outline shape. The skewers in the pot above can be added according to your preference.\n4. When painting the backdrop, use thicker lines to outline the contour, and the corners can be guided to the ground with lines. For coloring, use ochre mixed with ink. For the banana tree in the background, use floral blue mixed with rattan yellow, and you can add a bit of floral blue to the tip of the brush, using large brushstrokes for #dot painting. Around the figures below, you can also use a small fine-line brush to simply draw some grass, mainly to render the ambiance of a picnic.\nXuan paper inner diameter 33*33, medium-size mixed-hair brush, small red hair fine-line brush\nPaints: floral blue, rattan yellow, cinnabar, sanqing, ochre\nOptions: A.

It is responsible for filtering the engine oil, trapping impurities and contaminants, to ensure that various internal components of the engine are well-lubricated and protected. The oil filter is composed of multiple parts, among which the end cap is one of the key components. The end cap supports the structure of the filter, connects the filter element and the housing, and also serves as the passage for oil to enter and leave the filter.\n\nWhy does the oil filter end cap need to be sealed?\n\nDuring the daily operation of the filter, the oil enters the end cap, passes through the filtering action of the filter element, and finally leaves the filter. The sealing and stability of the end cap are crucial for the normal operation of the filter.\n\nIf the sealing of the end cap is poor, oil may leak from the seams between the end cap and the filter element or housing. This can lead to oil loss and may affect the normal operation of the engine. Additionally, the stability of the end cap also affects the overall structure and performance stability of the filter. If the end cap is loose or detached, it may cause deformation of the filter structure, and even affect the filtration efficiency of the filter.\n\nTo address these issues, bonding the end cap has become a common method. Through bonding and potting processes, the end cap can be firmly fixed to the filter element and housing, forming a complete seal to prevent oil leakage. Moreover, bonding can enhance the stability of the connection between the end cap and other components.\n\nRecommended Product\n\nSIPC 587 organic silicone adhesive is a neutral deoxime type room-temperature curing silicone sealant, with a fine and impurity-free consistency, high strength and mechanical properties, excellent resistance to engine oil and lubricating oil. It is used for sealing the mating surfaces of various mechanical equipment components and can be easily disassembled for maintenance.\n\nProduct Characteristics:\n\n‚ñ∂ It has characteristics such as non-adhesive force and easy rework after curing.\n‚ñ∂ It also has excellent oil resistance and sealing properties.\nOptions: A. Foreign plastic wrap makeup B. The difference between evaporative condensers and condensing evaporators C. The difference between evaporative condensers and condensing evaporators D.

Firstly, there are many flight options, and the tickets are relatively affordable. Another reason is that you can also take the opportunity to shop around at the Hong Kong airport! (Unlike Shenzhen, there's really nowhere to go during the waiting time üòÇ)\nFriends who have flown from Hong Kong know that the airport has an incredible number of brands. You might get so carried away shopping that you feel like you're in a mall on Hong Kong Island!\nHowever, the pricing in Hong Kong is consistent throughout, so there aren't any special discounts at the airport. The only thing you can look forward to is finding those popular items that are often out of stock in the city. At the airport, they might become hidden gems for shoppers.\n‚≠êÔ∏è Fashion Brands:\nChanel (firmly in the spotlight, with two floors dedicated to the iconic brand at the airport), Balenciaga, Bally, Burberry, BV, Dior, Dunhill, Furla, Givenchy, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Gucci, Loewe, Miumiu, Prada, Jimmy Choo, Valentino, Tory Burch, Zara... These are all concentrated in the central area of the L6 departure level;\n‚≠êÔ∏è Jewelry and Watches:\nBlancpain, Cartier, Chaumet, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Omega, Piaget, Tiffany&Co, Rolex...\n‚≠êÔ∏è Beauty products are all at Beauty&You, including brands like Chanel, YSL, Bobbi Brown, Benefit, Est√©e Lauder, SK2, Dior... mainly selling popular items and sets, with less common products usually not available at the airport store.\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è The list I've provided today is not exhaustive. I recommend that after passing through security, you pick up a guide map at the information desk shown in the second picture. It will clearly mark the locations of the stores you want to visit, saving you a lot of aimless wandering time.\n@Life Potato @Potato Captain @Fashionable Little Sister\nOptions: A.

The advantage is that if you're fishing in the grass, you can pull it out. It can also be used for boat fishing. But remember to match the correct line.\n2. The shallow spool of the 2500D today has an astonishing line capacity! You can use heavier lines.\n3. Sea water okay (5 CRBB)\n4. MAGSEALED magnetic oil waterproof\n5. Air rotor, similar to Shimano's MGL spool\n6. ATD brake. Daiwa's brake is really comfortable.\n7. LT concept, light and sturdy.\nDisadvantages:\n1. Expensive, and not made in Japan.\n2.

It is a type of tea that has gradually developed in Guangxi since the early 1960s. In 1974, the tea gardens south of the Hongshui River in Guangxi were listed as one of China's export bases for broken black tea. It is made from one bud and two or three leaves, undergoing withering, rolling, fermentation, initial drying, full firing, and refined processing before being evenly piled and packaged. The particles are tightly knit and substantial, with a strong and aromatic flavor. It is favored by tea merchants for its neutral properties and suitability for blending.

Is it considered one piece or two? I went to the store specifically to ask the staff. The female staff first said that one piece is counted as one item, so she would charge me 3500x2, which I was okay with, thinking that they would help me dispose of it. I've already spent so much, what's another 3500 yen, right? Then the weird thing happened. She grabbed a male staff member passing by and asked him. He said that buying one piece of furniture only allows for the disposal of an equivalent item, not buying one mattress and disposing of two. The female staff then told me, \"Oh, sorry, we can only take away one for you.\" I was really confused [black sweet potato question mark R][black sweet potato question mark R][black sweet potato question mark R]. This isn't even asking you to dispose of it for free, so what's the point of leaving one for me? At that point, I had lost all desire to shop. The male staff member probably saw that I didn't want to buy anymore (I was already filling out the order form) and asked me again about the type of mattress. I said it was the type where two are stacked together (which I had already told the female staff once) and even showed him a picture. Then he said, \"Okay, we'll count it as one\" ([goodbye R] Should I thank you?). Then came the long process of confirming the order, paying, and as I was holding the receipt, I casually asked how long the warranty period for the furniture was. Is it one year?\nThey were stumped by my question and started flipping through various documents and searching on the computer. I just sat there twiddling my thumbs [embarrassed R]. After twiddling for a long time and getting bored, I took out my phone to search online. The internet said that Muji furniture doesn't have a warranty period [black sweet potato question mark R]. I was a bit skeptical and insisted on waiting for the staff to give me an answer. Then they also told me there was no warranty period. I asked what to do if it breaks, and the male staff member said that if it's confirmed to be a quality issue, they would replace it [black sweet potato question mark R] (not to mention how to confirm a quality issue, there's no specified time limit for replacing it if a quality issue arises within a few years, right?). The female staff member blurted out, \"Because it's already very cheap, there's no warranty period.\" Cheap? A single bed frame plus a single mattress for 87800 yen, where is it cheap? [goodbye R][goodbye R][goodbye R][goodbye R]. Later, I just left, and now the more I think about it, the angrier I get.\n\nOptions: A. More than a thousand yen for a haircut B.

Soak the ink core from a marker in alcohol, extract the color, and evenly apply it to the canvas shoe surface. The advantage is that it's easy to operate and can be done at home. The disadvantage is that it tends to reverse color, with black fading relatively quickly.\n\n2. Use dye water for coloring, as dye water has strong penetration. It requires careful brushing and coloring, and a color fixation process must be done after treatment.\nIf you don't want to do it yourself for fear of messing up, you can also leave it to us [blushing R] or use pre-mixed color restorer to apply it at home.\n\nOptions: A.

When touching up makeup, I can control the amount and apply a thin layer, and the key is that it can last a long time without getting oily. The powder is very fine. It gives a feeling of naturally good skin. There's a slight shimmer when first applied, but it's not very noticeable indoors and has the effect of blurring pores. The only downside is the price [Laughing R][Laughing R][Laughing R]. Since it's not cheap, I use it specifically for touch-ups.\n\nPurberry Black Pepper: How to put it, it's not that bad, but it's not that good either. I think it's an ordinary loose powder without any special highlights. It wins in being affordable and having a large quantity. If budget doesn't allow, it can be used, and there's no major issue. Considering the price, we can't be too harsh on the quality. It slightly tests the foundation and application technique. After taking the powder, make sure to use the puff to blend it before applying to the face [OK R][OK R][OK R]. It tends to look a bit dull by the afternoon.\n\nFunnyElves: It's cheap, but my goodness, the powder is coarse. It's prone to clumping and caking, which is a bit annoying [Disappointed R][Disappointed R][Disappointed R]. The key is that it dulls quickly, not recommended.\nAlso, remember to use a tissue to blot the oil on your face before using any loose powder for touch-ups.\nOptions: A. Pepper Powder Nars B.

Recently, while watching tutorials, I noticed the step where a layer of UV glue is applied to the background image to prevent oil leakage. This suddenly made me think of puzzle glue, which doesn't require a light, is easy to defoam, doesn't shrink, is price-friendly, and most importantly, has less toxicity than UV glue.\n(Baidu says it's a non-toxic, harmless, environmentally friendly, water-soluble glue made for children. I don't believe it's completely non-toxic, but it's definitely much better than UV glue. I've personally tested it during the puzzle application process, using a large amount without any irritating smell or discomfort.)\nHowever, whether water-soluble glue can be waterproof and oil-resistant is uncertain, which sounds a bit risky. This means that the initial idea of directly applying it to the background image to prevent oil might not work, so it's best to avoid contact with oil at first.\nAfter sealing the holes and attaching the foreground image, applying a layer directly to replace the coating should be feasible, as it becomes very sturdy when dry on puzzles. Even shaking a 1000-piece puzzle won't make it fall apart. Additionally, the glue makes the puzzle colors brighter, and it solidifies in about one to two hours, preferably left overnight and checked in the morning.\nPrice: I randomly searched for a glue, 120ml/11r, which can cover two 1000-piece puzzles (usually 50*75cm in size). Converted for a 13*7.5 flow linen shell, it's 50*75*2√∑(13*7.5)=77 pieces.\n\nOptions: A. Recommended Spray Paint for Plaster Dolls B. Recommended Spray Paint for Plaster Dolls C.

There are disposable pads on the chairs, and small pillows for the waist. If you feel cold, you can get a small blanket.\n\n[Peach R] Technician\n‚ö†Ô∏è We chose two services: one is foot bath and the other is ear cleaning. Unfortunately, there is no special service for shoulder, neck, and head massage, which I really love [Cry R]\n[Two Hearts R] Foot Bath: It includes shoulder and back massage and foot washing, with high cost-performance.\nThe technician's strength was just right, and the session also included stretching, etc. Make sure to relax, as tight muscles can easily get injured. If it's really unbearable, communicate with the technician immediately!\nThe foot bath offers a choice of ginger, mugwort, or milk. We all chose mugwort, but I felt the concentration was not high, so don't expect this foot bath to bring much, it's just for relaxation. For the foot massage, only a small part was a bit itchy, the rest was wrapped in a towel, so those who are afraid of tickling can also give it a try!\n[Two Hearts R] Ear Cleaning: There are fewer ear cleaning technicians, and when it was our turn, there was only one technician in our room, so the three of us took turns.\nAlthough I am a severe ASMR sufferer, I am quite scared of ear cleaning. This was my first attempt. [Two Hearts R] It felt tingling and comfortable, but those with sensitive ears should consider it carefully.\n\nAfter experiencing ear cleaning, my interest in ASMR decreased by half, hahaha\n‚ùå The downside is that the cost-performance is not high, 79 yuan seems to be only about fifteen minutes, and the duration depends on the technician's personal preference [Cover Face R][Cover Face R]\n\n[Peach R] Food\nA major reason we chose Shen Garden Hall is the abundance of food,\nwhich can be considered a meal. The portions are small but can be refilled indefinitely, and the variety of fruits is also comprehensive. As for tea, I feel green tea is better than black tea, as black tea needs to be steeped for a while or twice to taste good.

Meeting these criteria was enough, so I purchased the front door as shown in Figure 1‚É£Ô∏è.\n\nUnder the store's lighting, the bluish-gray flat door looked simple and durable, which seemed acceptable. However, when it arrived at my home, in the dimly lit corridor, it turned into the bluish-black as shown in Figures 2‚É£Ô∏è and 3‚É£Ô∏è [crying R], looking unmistakably black from a distance.\n\nThe old and small building has a low floor height of 2.5 meters. Choosing a front door with a door header did not make the door look tall and upright but instead made the house appear low and cramped. Therefore, for old and small houses, be cautious about choosing doors with door headers [facepalm R].\n\nThe door opening of the old and small house is narrow, the building is old, and the wall structure is unclear, making it difficult to modify the door opening. Doors with door headers cannot be fully recessed into the door opening; only the door frame can be embedded in the original opening, with the door header exposed outside. As a result, from the outside, both the door frame and the door header protrude from the wall, with mine protruding 5 centimeters (Figures 4‚É£Ô∏è and 5‚É£Ô∏è). This protrusion is too large and unsightly. I considered modifying the door opening, but the difficulty was too great, so I gave up and left it as it is.\n\nThe renovation process is about making do and constantly reassuring oneself. If I had to do it again, I would definitely follow these points when choosing a front door:\n1. No doors with door headers; don't believe in the so-called high-door grandeur.\n2. Customization: Make sure to request a custom-made door according to measured dimensions before placing an order. If not specified, standard doors are usually provided.\n3. Pay attention to color differences; the color may look good in the store, but it might not be as expected in your own corridor.\n4. Supervise the entire installation process; do not just use foam sealant in the door gaps. If possible, fill with wood strips or tile strips for better sound insulation.\n\nOptions: A.
