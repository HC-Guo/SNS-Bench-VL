I don't have a special love for game consoles, but I have to get this one to justify my childhood. The graphics are great and satisfying. Initially, I didn't know how to use the Switch and was very nervous. I searched for tutorial videos online and found them very detailed and easy to follow. I suggest new buyers watch videos on how others set it up to get a general understanding and avoid panic (refer to the tutorial video in the last image).\nIt's best to connect to the screen at first for a better experience. For the process of catching monsters, leveling up, and accumulating experience, I recommend using the machine directly as it is faster and more accurate.\n\nI probably bought it at the lowest price online. Hong Kong is currently very short of stock, and prices will only rise, not fall, because it is a limited edition. But for those who already have a Switch, I think it's unnecessary to buy another one.

I found this restaurant on OpenRice, and as someone who loves shrimp and crab, I specially invited my younger sister to try it~ The location is in Kowloon City, and those familiar with the area know there are many delicious Thai restaurants there üòã. The storefront isn't very big, but the seating is quite spacious, much better than tea restaurants~ After sitting down, my sister and I each ordered a bowl of rice soup. I chose the signature original flavor, and my sister opted for the Tom Yum soup flavor (actually, she doesn't like Tom Yum at all, but after it was served, she quietly finished the whole bowl üòÖ).\nThe signature shrimp soup base is slightly spicy with a fresh and sweet taste, and there's a hint of fried garlic aroma. The shrimp in the side dishes are fresh, not frozen, and quite large in size, with a very good texture üòã. The rice soup itself is 48 HKD per serving, with a variety of side dishes, enough for a girl. Adding half a lobster costs an extra 50 HKD, totaling 98 HKD~ If it's not enough to eat, you can add more dishes, and the prices are reasonable~ ‚ú®. Additionally, the restaurant also offers rice soup with fish maw chicken soup, which I haven't tried yet. I'll give it a try next time I visit HK üòª.\n\nCategory Options: A. Wedding B. Food C.

I'd like to share some essential items I always bring with me when traveling overseas (there's everything), because everything is expensive abroad, and being well-prepared saves both worry and money~\n\n‚ú®Multi-functional Travel Adapter\nOnce you're out of the mainland, you need to consider whether the power outlets match everywhere, so a universal travel adapter is a must-have. It's small and comes with a storage case, so you don't have to worry about losing it.\n\n‚ú®Travel-sized Shampoo\nAs someone with sensitive skin, I usually stick to the shampoo I'm used to, so I always bring a travel-sized bottle of my regular shampoo when I travel. I usually bring NOVELLA's Freesia Raspberry (oil-control and volumizing) shampoo, which is great for oily hair. For dry hair, choose Bluebell Sea Salt, and for dyed or permed hair, choose Cherry Blossomüå∏ and Orange Blossom.\n\n‚ú®Hair Treatment Oil\nWhen visiting islands, it's inevitable to go swimming in the sea, and the damage to your hair afterward can be likened to straw. So, it's essential to bring a deeply nourishing hair oil. I usually bring NOVELLA's Amber Moroccan Oil. [Cute R] It smells absolutely wonderful, with a very romantic fragrance. It's nourishing without being sticky and absorbs quickly. If you have diving activities, this is a must-bring.\n\n‚ú®Sunscreen\nSunscreen is a must-have, or you'll turn into a coal ball or get sunburned! My go-to choices are Anessa Gold Bottle and DQ. I use DQ when not going in the water and Anessa when swimming. With sufficient SPF and a parasol‚òÇÔ∏è, you won't turn into a coal ball!\n\n‚ú®Travel-sized Bottles\nI'm not used to the hotel shampoos, so I always bring my own in travel-sized bottles. The same goes for skincare products. Considering airline regulations on carry-on liquids, travel-sized bottles help lighten the load. Label them, and it's easy to identify what's what.\n\n‚ú®Toiletry Bag | Packing Cubes\nGirls tend to have a lot of small itemsüíÖ, and a toiletry bag helps keep everything organized, so things don't scatter when you open your suitcase. Moreover, packing cubes are also essential, as they help categorize clothes and ensure the hygiene of undergarments.\n\n‚ú®Alcohol Swabs | Iodine Swabs\nBreak open one end of the cotton ball, and the liquid flows to the other end, convenient and hygienic. I once cut myself on coral while diving and used these to treat it. If you're afraid of the pain from alcohol, opt for iodine; both are for disinfection.\n\n‚ú®Portable Water Bottle\nYou can never be sure what's been in hotel kettles... This water bottle is foldable, doesn't take up much space, and is made of food-grade silicone. After boiling water a couple of timesüí¶, it doesn't leave any taste. If you're traveling with a baby, this is a must-have for convenient formula preparation.\n\nCategory Options: A. Education B. Other C. Entertainment D.

These days, all the food recommendations are completed in the office. [GrinningR] [GrinningR] During leisure time after work, I discuss with my colleagues what you use at home, what I use, which one is good, and go crazy planting grass. [BlowKissR] [BlowKissR] Recently, the company replaced a new refrigerator, thank goodness, it's finally replaced. The previous one, I don't know if it was used for too many years or the quality was just average. The preservation effect was really not commendable. Every time I bring lunch, I have to put it inside, and it tends to absorb odors when placed inside, but if not, the air conditioning warm air can't keep it. [LaughingCryingR] [LaughingCryingR] Many colleagues initially put some daily drinks like honey lemon, Lao Gan Ma cans, etc., inside, but later they all removed them. It's probably because it's a shared refrigerator, and too many people use it, it's inevitable. However, the newly replaced one recently is not bad. Firstly, it looks much more stylish, no need to hide in the corner of the pantry, and the capacity is obviously larger than before, no need to fight for space every time fearing there's no place to put it. The preservation also feels much better than before. Because some people in the company like to drink iced water in summer, we specifically chose this model that can make ice. [DrinkingBubbleTeaR] [DrinkingBubbleTeaR] Personal experience of food recommendations feels more reliable. I've already found out the model: Hisense BCD-528WFK1DPLQ, just in time, my home needs to replace the refrigerator, planning to get one. [PullingFaceH]\n\nCategory Options: A. Pets B. Fashion C.

After one jump, I wanted to do it again. My friends say I'm weird üòÇ. I started from Guangzhou South and took a Didi to the entrance of Baiyun Mountain bungee jumping. Ticket: 5üí∞. If you have a Guangzhou universal transit card, you can just tap it. Single jump: 300üí∞ (WeChat payment accepted). Don't be fooled by the sign on the wall that says cash only, because I fell for it. So I went to a convenience store on the mountain to exchange cash and was charged a 5% fee (15üí∞). Photo: 30üí∞, Video: 60üí∞. I got both. If you want photos, remember to look at the staff's camera when you jump. You can ask where the camera is before you jump. Remember to be mentally prepared, because once you jump, you'll involuntarily lose your sense of direction and feel overwhelmed. After jumping, there's a free certificate, but laminating it costs 10üí∞. Friendly reminder: Before jumping, put away all your jewelry, shoes, and valuables. The jumping order is based on weight because the staff needs to adjust the rope length. When it's time to jump, you won't have any time to prepare, because as soon as the guy adjusts your gear, he'll push you down while you're still in a daze. Remember to spread your arms and legs when jumping, and don't grab the rope or safety harness. When you come up, unlock and relax as you ascend üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

In \"Ode to Joy,\" Xie Tong says, \"Apart from being a bit far, there's nothing bad about Xinjiang.\" This statement was perfectly confirmed after my parents came here. Their biggest worry was that I wouldn't eat on time, so they brought lots of snacks (so touched [crying R]). But after seeing me, they actually said I had gained a lot of weight and asked if I was pregnant (really my own parents). Then I started taking them to eat! Eat!! Eat!!! Knowing that I wouldn't go hungry, they felt reassured and went back. In Xinjiang, it's true that you won't go hungry because the local cuisine is so diverse that you can eat different dishes every day without repetition!\n[blush R] [blush R] [blush R]\n\nCategory Options: A.

Thankfully, I have a great mother-in-law and a great husband who didn't let me worry about anything. Moving into a beautiful new home, especially right across from my workplace, how blessed can I get!!! The style is postmodern luxury, with a house area of over two hundred square meters. Functional rooms include: a walk-in closet, a bar lounge (converted from a room, as my husband and I enjoy wine), and a home theater installed on the second floor, so we no longer need to go to the cinema.

I still vividly remember how he lay in bed moaning in pain. As his daughter, besides accompanying him to the hospital and occasionally pushing him in a wheelchair for a walk, I could do nothing but feel helplessüòñüòñ\nInitially, we didn't realize it when grandpa had a gout attack until we noticed his right foot was swollen, which made us suspect it might be gout, so we immediately took him to the hospital. When we got the test report, his uric acid level had already exceeded the normal range, reaching over 500üò±. The doctor said that the elevated uric acid was due to poor dietary habits and advised my dad to avoid alcohol, seafood, and animal organs, as prolonged consumption would lead to higher uric acid levels in the body, triggering gout attacks~\n‚òÅLater, the doctor prescribed medication, but the gout didn't ease. I even bought various gout treatments online for my dad, but the effects were not significant, and the side effects were severe. So, I had to ask friends and search online for other treatments. Eventually, a medical school classmate introduced me to a department director at their hospital. After understanding my dad's condition, the director recommended that my dad take chicory and gardenia fermentation liquid to lower his uric acid levels and strictly avoid alcohol, seafood, etc.\nThe director explained that this fermentation liquid is mainly made from six Chinese herbs (chicory, gardenia, kudzu root, mulberry leaf, lily, and corn silk), combined with probiotics for fermentation. It effectively reduces uric acid and regulates gout with minimal side effects. After about two months of taking it, my dad felt a significant reduction in foot pain and could walk more easily. When we went back for a check-up, his uric acid levels had dropped considerably. Seeing this result, I couldn't help but feel happy that my dad no longer had to endure the torment of goutüëèüëè\nIn the following days, I also made sure my dad took the chicory and gardenia fermentation liquid regularly and paid close attention to his diet, avoiding alcohol and foods that trigger gout, such as seafood, animal organs, and high-fructose foods. After meals, I would take my dad for a walk. After two more months, when we went back to the hospital, his uric acid levels had returned to normal, and I finally felt relieved!‚òÄ\nMy dad's gout hasn't recurred, his walking is smooth, and his body is strong. I am so happy!!!!\nFriends in need can also bookmark this, and those with family members suffering from gout can give it a try!\n\nCategory Options: A. Medical Health B. Sports and Fitness C.

You might say it's the parents' fault for not helping with homework, and indeed, they bear some responsibility. But isn't it normal for parents to worry when their child's learning is not solid? I asked the child, \"How do your teachers teach you methods?\" He then said that most teachers teach how to score points on exams, focusing on easy-to-score questions, and even then, they mostly address the students sitting in front, basically ignoring those in the back.\n\nToday, I really wanted to ask the teacher what was going on. Maybe my tone wasn't very good, but I asked the teacher if it was true, hoping for a response. Instead, the teacher blamed me for not changing my nickname. I had changed it when I joined the group, but I deliberately removed it when asking questions, fearing the teacher might cause trouble for the child at school [DisappointedR] [DisappointedR].\n\nAfter being kicked out of the group, I added the teacher again, but they set their privacy settings.

It seems to be highly recommended on Xiaohongshu, with a reasonable price, high cost-performance, and good looks. I originally wanted to look at Panasonic, but upon checking, there are really too many models, and they all look the same. I feel that negative ion hair dryers are quite useful. I have fine and soft hair, which tends to fall out and get static in winter. A couple of years ago when I went to Japan, I was determined to buy a negative ion hair dryer, and after using it, the static was much better, especially with the comparison, my hair was much smoother.\nTalking about the Soocas one, it has a strong wind and dries hair faster than Panasonic. Some people say it's heavy, but compared to the previous large and old-fashioned hair dryer, it's definitely lighter than Panasonic's, and with the quick drying, it shouldn't reach the point of blowing until your hand gets sore. About the negative ions, the Soocas one, at least when I first used it, didn't make my hair frizzy, but comparing the price of 250 yuan VS 600 yuan, Soocas really has a high cost-performance.\n\nCategory Options: A.

Yesterday, I went to Galeries Lafayette for dinner with a friend, and after eating, we strolled into a boutique. I fell in love with two pairs of Korean Vedi Vero 2018 sunglasses, which they said could be discounted up to 50%, but the staff said it had to be sold with another item. After much deliberation, I chose the cheapest scented candle. Personally, I don't use candles, but this one is super cute on the outside, and the scent is a blend of cream with a hint of rose. The more I smell it at home, the more I like it [Flying Kiss R]. After checking online, I found out that this brand was founded by Troy and Traci in 1999 as the first in the American industry to use coconut wax as its main ingredient and obtained a patent for it. Now it is found in top malls and boutiques worldwide, a must-have home fragrance series for many celebrities, and the official fragrance for Hollywood award ceremonies. The design elements of the container materials vary, and after burning, they can be left as collectibles and decorations. With professional blending technology and experienced fragrance developers, the scent is fresh and natural, can last longer, and can produce surprisingly different scents over time! Thumbs up! Does anyone know if there's a body lotion with this scent? I love it so much [Crying R].\nOrigin: USA, Ingredients: 100% natural coconut wax\n\nCategory Options: A. Technology & Digital B.

If understood broadly, alignment means placing the bones in the correct position, and placing the bones in the correct position requires the correct muscle activation.\n\nThe external manifestation is mainly the alignment of joints. Misaligned joints can lead to strains in ligaments, muscles, and fascia. First, imagine the body as a skeleton, such as aligning the warrior's knee with the ankle, or the shoulder joint with the wrist in the plank pose, etc.\n\nThen, give the skeleton flesh and blood, activate the relevant muscles to align the joints. However, if it is not possible to achieve the standard due to limitations in muscles, ligaments, or fascia (for example, if the angle between the knee and calf in the warrior pose is greater than 90 degrees), then just stay there.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the alignment of breath, such as inhaling when the body extends and exhaling when the body contracts.\n\nFinally, a very important point is the alignment of thoughts. Do not force yourself into poses that the body is not ready for, avoid comparisons, and do not practice challenging poses with negative emotions, etc.\n\nCategory Options: A. Entertainment B.

Boil the eggs (not runny) and soak them in cold water to make peeling easier.\n2. Peel the eggs and separate the egg whites from the yolks.\n3. Mash the egg whites and yolks separately (I used a fork and spoon, haha) as finely as possible.\n4. Add mayonnaise to the yolks and mix first, then after it's smooth, add the egg white crumbles and continue to mix evenly. If you prefer a smoother texture, add more mayonnaise; if you like a firmer texture, add less, depending on personal preference.\n5. Season with a little salt and black pepper (white pepper is also OK), mix well, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate, bingo~ done!\nAnd there you have it, a quick and delicious breakfast companion! Paired with fragrant toast bread (see the previous post for the rich white toast tutorial), it's simply perfect!

Actually, I have always been interested in the development of ancient Egyptian civilization, and I am quite fascinated by their most famous pyramids, mummies, and pharaohs. It is rare to have such an exhibition in Hangzhou, so I took the opportunity to visit.\n\nThe exhibition is only available in the Gu Shan area, with tickets priced at 30 yuan. The venue is divided into three levels, and the exhibits are not that numerous. I went on a Friday, and there were quite a few people, indicating that the people of Hangzhou still have an interest in Egyptian culture, as such exhibitions are not very common in Hangzhou. All the items on display are authentic, but they are mostly more common objects. Items of significant value would not be displayed here; it's just an opportunity for those who have never seen them to get a glimpse.\n\nInside the museum, there are graphic introductions, guides providing explanations, and QR codes on glass surfaces for self-guided audio tours. Representative items on display include door panel carvings from Egyptian pyramids, mummies, animal mummies, amulets, containers for mummy organs, sarcophagi for mummies, makeup items used by ancient Egyptians, and decorative items. There are also some ancient Egyptian deities and the like. Overall, I feel there are not enough items, but for those new to Egyptian culture, it is still a decent showcase.\n\nCategory Options: A.

Therefore, I have requirements for laundry products; they must be free of fluorescent agents and able to remove various stains without residue, which is the most basic requirement for laundry products.\nüôà I've tried various laundry detergents to keep up with trends, but lately, laundry beads seem to be the most popular, so I decided to try out a product recommended by Liu Tao, Kent's Blue Kitchen, and share my experience with everyone.\nüíß Advantages: It's quite convenient to throw a bead in during laundry, without needing to add fabric softener, as it has a built-in softening function.

Previously, thyroid examinations relied on doctors' manual palpation, which could only detect nodules larger than 1cm. Now, with the help of sensitive ultrasound, nodules as small as 0.1cm cannot hide.\n2‚É£Ô∏è What symptoms can thyroid nodules cause?\nThe vast majority of thyroid nodules are benign and asymptomatic, often discovered during physical exams. Possible clinical manifestations include palpitations, irritability, fear of cold, fatigue, and excessive sleepiness.\n3‚É£Ô∏è What is the malignancy rate of thyroid nodules, and what characteristics might suggest malignancy?\nClinically, only about 5% to 15% of thyroid nodules are malignant thyroid cancers. Ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid cancer has a malignancy detection rate of 80% to 90%.\n4‚É£Ô∏è Can benign thyroid nodules become cancerous?\nThe possibility of benign thyroid nodules transforming into cancer is very small, but regular follow-ups are still recommended.\n5‚É£Ô∏è What are the treatment methods for thyroid nodules, and when is surgery needed?\nTreatment methods for thyroid nodules include medication, surgery, radioisotope therapy, and ethanol injection.\nMost thyroid nodules do not require surgery, which is only necessary if the nodule compresses the trachea or esophagus, or if there is a high suspicion of malignancy. The size of the nodule is not an absolute indicator for surgery.\n6‚É£Ô∏è Does having a thyroid nodule affect fertility?\nAs long as the thyroid nodule does not compress the esophagus or trachea, does not affect thyroid function, and has no malignant potential, it does not affect fertility.\n7‚É£Ô∏è If diagnosed with thyroid cancer, can it be cured?\nThyroid cancer is often jokingly referred to by doctors as a \"lazy cancer.\" With timely treatment, it generally does not threaten life. With surgery and radioactive iodine treatment, the ten-year survival rate can exceed 90%.\n8‚É£Ô∏è Which department should be consulted for thyroid nodules?\nAfter a thyroid nodule is detected during a physical exam, visit the endocrinology department to check thyroid function.\n\nCategory Options: A.

It has a salty and fresh taste, with white and thick soup, tender and fatty meat, and crispy and fragrant bamboo shoots. It is mainly a soup cooked with spring bamboo shoots and fresh and salty pork belly slices. \"Pickled\" refers to the preserved salty meat; \"Fresh\" refers to the fresh meat; \"Stewed\" means to simmer over a low fire.\nüèµIngredients: Spring bamboo shoots, Jinhua ham, pork belly, bean knots (dried tofu sticks), Shaoxing wine (or cooking wine), ginger slices\nüèµPreparation:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Peel and slice the spring bamboo shoots, blanch them in a pot with a spoonful of salt for about five minutes, then take them out and put them in a sand pot with water. Meanwhile, soak the dried tofu sticks in warm water.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Put ginger slices, three or four slices of pork belly, five or six slices of Jinhua ham, and two spoonfuls of Shaoxing wine into the sand pot, and simmer over a low fire for an hour.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ When the soup turns milky white and the aroma fills the air, add the soaked dried tofu sticks, continue to simmer over a low fire for another half hour, then season with salt and it's ready to eat.\n„äôÔ∏èTips:\nüëâüèª Bean knots can be replaced with dried tofu sticks\nüëâüèª Winter bamboo shoots can be used when spring bamboo shoots are out of season\nüëâüèª Cooking wine can be used if Shaoxing wine is not available\nüëâüèª Blanching the bamboo shoots can remove bitterness and earthy flavors\nIt is said that this dish was served by Hu Xueyan to Zuo Zongtang. Due to Zuo Zongtang's accent, he pronounced \"Pickled and Stewed Fresh\" as \"Pickled and Stewed Crisp,\" and later when Zuo Zongtang settled in Shanghai, he introduced it to the city. Regardless, its flavor can make people \"lose themselves,\" it's just too delicious. üòÇ\n\nCategory Options: A. Entertainment B. Funny C. Travel D.

You can spend an entire day inside and still not see everything. It is a very large wildlife park with a comprehensive variety of animals. You can take a free cable car, but you need to queue. There is also a sightseeing train for close-up views of the animals. The park recommends that visitors bring their own snacks like bread, as the restaurants inside are pricey. There are also some small amusement facilities that you can enjoy by simply queuing up. So, if you want to visit a zoo, this place is really comprehensive [wink R] [wink R]\n\nCategory Options: A.

We bought first-class seats, and the cost turned out to be cheaper than flying. The high-speed train tickets for one adult and two children in first class were 2950 yuan. Since my husband was already in Kunming, I took the two kids on the high-speed train to Kunming, and my husband picked us up at the train station.\nDAY2: January 23rd\nStay at Tianheng Hotel in Kunming (502 yuan via Ctrip)\nItinerary: Cuihu Park (free admission) - Jiaowutang (free admission) - Yunnan Provincial Museum (free admission) chose places kids would enjoy\nAfter waking up naturally in the morning, we drove to Cuihu Park to feed the seagulls. Jiaowutang is right next to Cuihu Park, just a short walk away. We had lunch at the Qingniao Chunshang Western Restaurant beside Cuihu Park, which the whole family thought was not tasty.\nIn the afternoon, we drove to the provincial museum, which is worth visiting with kids, though the traffic was a bit congested. Not sure if the subway can get there, if so, it should be more convenient (not verified)\nDinner: Hushang Longtang in Nanqiang Street. (Recommended by my husband, he eats here every time he comes to Kunming)\nDAY3: January 24th\nStay at Kunming Mengjing Wangjiao Boutique Hotel (260 yuan for Alipay Diamond Member)\nItinerary: Dianchi Lake - Ethnic Village - 1903\nAfter waking up naturally in the morning, we headed straight to Dianchi Lake but couldn't find a parking spot, so we drove around the edge and went directly to the Ethnic Village. The Ethnic Village is worth visiting with kids, we basically visited every ethnic group. I bought adult tickets on Meituan (80 yuan per person), children under 120CM are free, so we bought half-price tickets on site as the kids exceeded the height limit.\nAfter visiting the Ethnic Village, we went to 1903 for dinner. There's an indoor playground inside that's supposed to be good, but since the kids are older, it wasn't suitable for them, so we didn't go. 1903 is a good place for photos, but since neither my husband nor I are good at taking pictures, we just made a brief visit and had a meal.\nDAY4: January 25th\nKunming-Yuanjiang\nAlready have a rental house in Yuanjiang\nConsidering the long distance from Kunming to Xishuangbanna by self-driving, we chose to stay overnight in Yuanjiang, which is in the middle, before heading to Xishuangbanna.\nTo be continued\n\nCategory Options: A.

Later, whenever my nose itched, I knew a cold was approaching soon. This feeling is extremely uncomfortable, a sensation only those with rhinitis can truly understand. The amount of tissue I use every day can pile up like a mountain.\nüí®üí®üí®\nIn recent years, as I've been preparing to have a baby, the pressure of life has become overwhelming. I had to go out and work to share some of the burden with my husband, but the rhinitis bothered me a lot, affecting both my mood and work performance. I was always in a bad mood because I couldn't sleep well at night, making me listless at work.\nüóªüóªüóª\nOne day, a cleaning lady at the company noticed my condition and came over to ask about it. She said she used to have the same issue with rhinitis but got cured. Then she told me about a medicine called üêæüêæüêæYuan Zheng Qingüêæüêæüêæ ointment, advising me to apply it when I had time, two to three times a day.

Whenever I talk about going out to eat with friends, I always think of this place, affordable and delicious.\nI always order the oyster omelette and braised pork rice. The oyster omelette is crispy and chewy, and the oysters have a slight fishy taste, which has been there every time I've eaten there, but it doesn't affect its deliciousness. The braised pork rice has a rich texture and is topped with crispy meat floss. This time, I finally tried the large intestine wrapped in small bun, not very authentic, but still very tasty~\nTheir silver thread rolls are very popular and take a long time to come out, always arriving after we're already full. Personally, I don't think they're very tasty, they look good in photos, but they're too sweet, and the ice cream melts quickly.

Boil them in a pot of cold water for about a minute, then take them out.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a clean pot, pour a little oil into it, add the ribs, and stir-fry over low heat until both sides are golden brown.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Pour in cooking wine, a little soy sauce, sprinkle in ginger slices, and one star anise. Stir-fry a few times, then add an appropriate amount of hot water and simmer for about 20 minutes.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Squeeze the orange juice and set it aside.

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that spring is the season dominated by liver qi, which is vigorous and can easily overcome the spleen earth, leading to weak spleen and stomach, unbalanced water and dampness, and internal dampness. Coupled with the continuous rainy weather in spring, external dampness is blocked, and the meridian blood and qi are not smooth. Excessive dampness often makes people feel fatigued, heavy limbs, and a foggy head, not feeling refreshed. To be energetic, clear-headed, and light-bodied, it is crucial to clear the dampness in the body.\n\nWhile expelling dampness, nourishing the liver, moisturizing the lungs, and replenishing vital energy are essential. In dietary therapy, eating well is not as good as eating smartly. Drink ginger soup for a cold stomach, eat goji berries for clear eyesight, and ginseng and lotus seed soup is a wonderful recipe for spring to nourish the liver, moisturize the lungs, and expel dampness.\n\nGinseng has a sweet and warm nature, which can greatly replenish vital energy, generate saliva to quench thirst, calm the mind, and improve intelligence. Regular consumption can alleviate fatigue, weakness, cough, asthma, night sweats due to yang deficiency, palpitations, forgetfulness, dizziness, and headache, helping to cope with discomfort in spring.\n\nLotus seeds are highly nutritious, with effects of tonifying the kidney, securing essence, nourishing the heart, and calming the mind, as well as strengthening the spleen, promoting diuresis, and expelling dampness. If dampness is severe, you can cook porridge with lotus seeds and foods like coix seed and red beans, which have a better effect on strengthening the spleen and removing dampness.\n\nGinseng and lotus seed soup is made by boiling ginseng and lotus seeds, with optional rock sugar (not recommended to use white sugar) to moisten the throat and add flavor.\n\nSpecific steps:\n1. Pour boiling water into a pot and add the soaked lotus seeds.\n2. Add the washed ginseng slices.\n3. Bring to a boil over high heat, then simmer for 40 minutes.\n4. Open the lid, add an appropriate amount of rock sugar, and simmer for another 4 minutes.\n5. Serve in a bowl.\n\nSpecial reminder: Rock sugar has the effect of stopping cough and resolving phlegm, and the amount can be adjusted according to personal taste. It is worth noting that due to limited conditions, it is best not to use iron pots or utensils when cooking at home to avoid affecting the efficacy.\n\nCategory options: A. Information B.

Chuanwangfu Hot Pot Restaurant on Xiamen Street in Jilin City!\nI've been in the northeast for three years, and it wasn't until my third year that I tried hot pot (of course, my first hot pot wasn't this one [EmbarrassedR]). Then I started to try all the hot pot restaurants nearby! And üìçChuanwangfuüìç is the super delicious hot pot I discovered! Now, let's start my performance.\nPicture one shows a pot bottom with 2 jin of ribs!!! There really are 2 jin of meaty ribs! But I still recommend cooking them a bit longer before eating, because ribs are best when they're really tender!\nPicture two is the interleaf fatty beef from the Meituan combo. Don't be fooled by its white parts, but it tastes amazing after cooking! Not greasy at all! Kudos to it [SlyR].\nPicture three is the pork belly from the Meituan combo. Meat is always good! [SmirkR]\nPicture four is Chinese cabbage! I'm a picky eater, I don't eat vegetables (I know it's not healthy, but I just can't change it [ShyR]), but my friend enjoyed it very much.\nPicture five is a mixed plate with wax gourd, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. They cook quickly in the pot and are very tasty.\nPicture six is the staple food, noodles. I didn't cook them long enough, so the noodles were a bit hard [PetrifiedR], but I still ate them. After all, you have to finish what you cook, no matter what!\nPicture seven is the crystal noodles from the combo. I was too full to wait for them to be cooked [ShyR], so I didn't get to taste them.\nPicture eight and nine are both self-service style! The crispy rice is super delicious and not damp at all! The black rice porridge is also very tasty with a hint of sweetness. I had two bowls [LaughingR].\nThere are also many types of hot pot condiments to choose from, and free drinks!

Beginners should first master the five-word mantra: temperature, light, water, air, fertilizer.\nCommon mistakes of beginners are often manifested in improper handling of watering, fertilizing, lighting, temperature, and environmental control, which can often lead to the death of the flower.\nI believe that many reasons for killing flowers are actually due to a lack of understanding of basic plant growth principles, with incorrect concepts.\nTherefore, I am more inclined to talk about the principles behind certain methodologies and techniques, so that all flower lovers can grow their plants beautifully~\nThere are many types of plants, but there are some general principles that are basically applicable to most household garden plants, unless you are cultivating a Welwitschia or some rare plant, so some advice like \"managing with different methods according to the basic habits and different categories of plants\" is basically a correct but useless statement. Only through personal practice of flower cultivation and summarizing after practice can one elevate to specific care methods for plants of particular ecological types and habits, which is the path to becoming a skilled flower cultivator.\nI am also trying, and the above is the summary I have collected from experts, to learn together with all flower enthusiasts.\n\nCategory Options: A.

Tickets: Book tickets one day in advance on Ctrip. Compared to the official website, the booking service fee is 20 yuan more expensive, but the process is clear and convenient.\nTickets are for a random time slot, but entry is in batches according to the ticket, so it's essential to arrive precisely or early. If buying on the day, the queue is extremely long.\n3. Attractions: While waiting to enter Neuschwanstein Castle, we also climbed up to the Old Swan Castle and took photos on the suspension bridge. It took about 1-2 hours.\nYou can take a bus from the foot of the mountain to Neuschwanstein Castle, 7 euros round trip.\n4. Feelings: The weather is very important!

Usually, everything is arranged before leaving, but this time it was quite sudden, yet it turned out to be the best trip so far.\nSand and water are indeed the best toys for children. From the day we entered the desert, the little one was overjoyed. While adults were panting climbing the sand dunes, she enjoyed it tirelessly.\nThis trip, including the journey, lasted a total of seven days, with the family spending around 7500 yuan. We didn't visit many tourist spots; the favorites were the two sand-playing sessions at Mingsha Shan and the desert camping. Sandboarding, beach motorcycles, camel riding‚Äîshe wanted to play more after each activity. For children, I think simplifying the itinerary to just playing with sand is enough; those western route itineraries are not very interesting for them, and honestly, not even for adults. If time permits, the Great Loop around Qinghai Lake is worth a visit, but we had to give it up due to time constraints.\nStaying in the Crescent Spring Inn street during the off-season cost only a bit over 120 yuan per night. The journey was a bit far, involving a plane and then a train, but the travel time is also part of the adventure for children, always more fun than staying at home.\n\nCategory Options: A. Travel B.

Taking Bluetooth 4.2 as an example, its transmission speed is 1.5MB/s with a standard latency of 3ms.\nA major feature of Bluetooth technology is its ability to connect multiple devices. For digital devices or computers, a single Bluetooth controller can simultaneously connect peripherals such as headphones, keyboards, and mice, making it very convenient to use. Additionally, the current mainstream Bluetooth 4.x standard has a latency of 3ms, which means its reporting rate can only reach a maximum of 333Hz, inherently falling short of the 500Hz to 1000Hz required by gaming mice, and the frequent sleep delays further reduce the reporting rate, well below the standard for gaming mice.\nAs for traditional 2.4G mice, their protocol is simpler and they do not have such frequent sleep modes, resulting in better latency performance than Bluetooth, and thus can achieve higher reporting rates. However, there are now too many devices using the 2.4GHz band! Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4G phones, cordless phones, etc. The traditional 2.4G protocol is simpler than Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, so it has the poorest anti-interference ability. Therefore, in the current usage environment, while the reporting rate of general 2.4G mice is higher than that of Bluetooth, the error rate is also higher, leading to unstable cursor positions. A phone call can cause the mouse cursor to wander erratically across the screen, clearly not meeting the demands of high-end mice.\n\nCategory Options: A. Entertainment B. Gaming C.

I felt completely overwhelmed, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. On Xiaohongshu, I saw many people using foot pads, and despite not knowing if it was scientifically sound, I decided to give it a try. I used them for three days; the second image shows the pad from the first day, and the third image from the second day. It seemed like the oiliness increased each day, but they didn't leak. Combined with foot soaking and eating donkey-hide gelatin, I could fall asleep before midnight. However, I'm not sure if the foot pads contributed to this, as I used multiple methods. But they felt warm and comfortable on my feet, which might have helped a bit with sleep. As for specific effects like dampness removal and detoxification, I'll share more with my fellow sweet potato babies after using them a bit longer.\n\nCategory Options: A. Hobbies B.

At this time, the salary is not very high, and we often have to travel. When we have the ability to become VMD later, your salary will be higher. Similarly, the things you do will be many. At this time, in addition to what we can do in Display, we also need to be able to do display guidelines, develop display manuals, spatial flow, window design, master color usage proficiently, and be very good at matching, etc.!\n3Ô∏è‚É£ People often ask me about the salary of Display Designers, including my personal salary. In my notes, I mentioned that I switched from warehouse management and sales. I am very obsessed and passionate about being a Display Designer. The reason I do this job is not related to salary. Second, salary is a company's business secret and personal privacy. When we sign contracts, we all sign not to disclose the company's business secrets. Discussing salaries with colleagues is strictly punished! As a company employee, I will keep the company's secrets, and as an individual, it is also a personal privacy issue.\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Display Designer positions - Display Assistant - In-store Display Designer - Regional Display Designer - Display Supervisor - Display Manager - Visual Director\nEveryone should work steadily. If you want a high salary, first ask yourself: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Do I have a comprehensive understanding of the Display Designer industry? 2Ô∏è‚É£ Have I met all the requirements for a Display Designer? 3Ô∏è‚É£ Do I master the practical skills, aesthetics, management, art, fashion, retail, products, design, display props, etc. of a Display Designer? Do I have an understanding of global brands? etc.\nPersonally, I don't like being asked about the salary of a Display Designer right away. The salary standards vary from city to city, and different positions have different salaries! Different brands also have different salaries, etc.!\nAll industries start from the bottom. No industry nurtures idlers or lazy people. There is no easy money in any industry. There is no industry without grievances or hard work. There is no high salary without effort. This reminds me of what our teacher said: \"A job with little work, high pay, close to home, respected, and no risk simply does not exist in the world.\"\nFrom executor ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è manager!\n\nCategory options: A.

However, the floor guides of both are not very comprehensive, and there are actually more brands in reality.\nTenjin and Hakata are the two major shopping districts in Fukuoka, about two kilometers apart.\nIf time is limited, shopping at Daimaru and Mitsukoshi in Tenjin is enough, as they have more luxury brands than Hankyu and also offer better service. The discounts are the same at both places, with a 5% discount and tax refund available for purchases over 5000 yen, with cash refunds being the most valuable and having the lowest handling fees.\nThe LV store at Daimaru is large, with more stock than Hankyu, and after tax refund, the prices are about 90% of those in China.\nThe price of the Black Bandage is not cheaper than at duty-free shops like Japan Duty-Free, roughly around 2500 yen.\nDon't worry about the language barrier, as staff can assist with Chinese translation through video or phone calls.\nWhen shopping and getting tax refunds, there are hardly any other customers around, making it very quiet and efficient, which is great.\nIf you're not buying luxury brands and just want to stroll around, Hakata Canal City between Hakata and Tenjin is suitable for leisurely walks, featuring more mainstream and local brands, and there are fountain performances to watch.\n\nCategory Options: A.

The Night King and the White Walkers are merely projections and symbols of the fear of 'death' in the collective consciousness of humanity. And 'death' might have been one of the greatest fears that humans have faced on both conscious and subconscious levels. This is why there are zombie films, 'The Walking Dead', and the White Walkers in GOT. The brutal war between humans and demons fully demonstrates how powerful this fear is; the more fear, the stronger it becomes, indestructible and able to revive at any time until it nearly overwhelms humanity.\n[Drink Milk Tea R]\nThe crucial blow by 'Two-Eyed Arya' to the 'Night King' in the ending perfectly symbolizes the awakening of humanity, that is, realizing that all the power of fear is what we ourselves endow. When we realize this, we can reclaim our power at any time. When we are nervously and passionately fighting against 'fear', we only give fear greater energy, until we are almost completely swallowed by fear, we finally discover that overcoming fear actually requires the most gentle action‚Äî‚Äî'awakening', so gentle that it is best to complete this symbol through the hands of 'Two-Eyed Arya'.

How to Properly Store West Lake Longjing Tea\n\nArticle Content: How should West Lake Longjing tea be stored to retain its flavor? Just follow these points, and you'll be fine!\n1. Keep it dry\nAfter the West Lake Longjing tea leaves are picked, they need to be spread out for a period of time. This process is to reduce the moisture content of the fresh leaves. Moreover, processes such as \"Green Pan Frying,\" \"Glazing,\" and \"Ash Collection\" all aim to reduce the moisture content of the tea leaves and keep them dry. Therefore, a good West Lake Longjing tea must have a qualified dryness level. During storage, if the tea leaves become damp, the flavor will naturally change.\n2. Low-temperature refrigeration\nAlthough the West Lake Longjing tea undergoes a frying process at temperatures above 100¬∞C, the finished tea leaves are not resistant to high temperatures. Generally, West Lake Longjing tea needs to be stored at a low temperature of 5-10¬∞C, which is why tea artists often take the tea from the refrigerator when serving tea in tea shops. When putting it in the refrigerator, also make sure not to let the tea leaves get damp.\n3. Sealed storage\nTea leaves naturally contain high molecular palm enzymes, which are active elements that easily absorb other odors, thus damaging the tea's flavor. Therefore, when storing West Lake Longjing tea, it needs to be sealed, which also prevents the chlorophyll and esters in the tea leaves from combining with the air, maintaining the tea's color. Generally, iron cans and porcelain cans are preferred.\nThese are the main points to note when storing West Lake Longjing tea. Good tea also requires proper storage methods; don't let a good tea go bad!\n\nCategory Options: A. Food B. Travel C. Entertainment D.

I've never asked for it and I'm not clingy. Besides work, I'm very immersed in my phone life, quietly listening to the TV, snacking, watching live streams, scrolling through Weibo, Xiaohongshu, browsing Taobao, playing Honor of Kings... Time flies by super fast and it's very fulfilling, okay üòÇ\nAs long as my boyfriend is home, he's quiet when watching TV, and I can do my own thing. Otherwise, he wants to drag me to watch movies, either at home or in the cinema. I'm the kind of person who has a hard time focusing, always checking my phone, so watching movies can be a huge ordeal for me (except for good ones) [Petrified R]. Mainly, if he wants me to watch a movie, he takes my phone away. sigh~ So I often end up watching movies I don't like, with low ratings, action or fight scenes, and I quietly close my eyes and accidentally fall asleep‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\nSo!\nSometimes when he goes out, I secretly enjoy it, feeling like the world is mine [Selfie R].\nBut!\nI don't know when it started, but he's learned to record videos when going out, even doing little introductions and including friends who say hi~~\nI really find it weird ü§®, mainly worrying that people might think I asked him to do it, which is a bit embarrassing, hahahahahaahaha ~ Even going out requires a real-time report [Cover Face R].\n\nSo Aquarius people are really annoying and weird, hard to control. I've also spent a lot of effort to half-understand. Anyway, Leos are also strong-willed and self-centered, but arguing is useless. Aquarius people have bizarre thought processes. It's best not to argue because you can't win [Sigh R]. Now, if I'm in the right, I just drop a key sentence and ignore him, eating, working, sleeping as usual. He figures it out himself and soon finds a way to back down üòÇ. If you want to be together, just forgive him. It's not a principled mistake anyway ~\nBut it's really tiring. Aquarius people are fickle, childish, insecure, sensitive, and cold-blooded. If you can choose, it's best not to date an Aquarius [Pick Nose R]. But once you're together, you can't let go. You need to balance things, not control directly, or he'll feel trapped and want to escape üòÇ (like a neurotic). When you don't seem to want to control, he'll obediently offer everything and is also very loyal. Sometimes his actions are particularly heartwarming, eh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\nWhether Aquarius and Leo are compatible, I don't know, but they won't get bored [Stick Out Tongue H][Pull Face H]\n\n\nCategory Options: A.

The first is working overtime and staying up late, often having to work endlessly to finish tasks. The second is drinking coffee, probably because of the frequent overtime, I often drink coffee to stay alert, and after drinking it a lot, I have come to like it‚úå‚úå. On weekends, I enjoy wandering around and discovering good coffee shops, almost never repeating the same place each week, constantly trying new ones and enjoying it immensely. üòöüòö\nI used to often think that if possible, I would definitely open a small coffee shop when I get old. Regardless of the hustle and bustle of the world, having such a peaceful and quiet place to retire wouldn't be bad~ Later on, I got myself a Tassimo mini coffee machine, and it feels absolutely wonderful to be able to enjoy good coffee at home! This movable \"coffee shop\" also has a very nice design, and it adds a highlight to the kitchen. The coffee machine is from the BOSCH brand, and it is very user-friendly~ The operation is simple, from placing the capsule to getting the coffee, it takes just one minute. üå∫üå∫\nThis little cutie has been with me for a month now, and during this time, enjoying the delicious coffee it provides has filled me with gratitude and comfort~ The coffee capsules are also collaborations with various big brands, offering different flavored options, which is super awesome. Good things need to be shared, it cost over 800 yuan, purchased from Tassimo's flagship store on Taobao, with many regular promotions, and the capsule coffee holder they gave is also great, making various capsules look very aesthetically pleasing when displayed~ üå∏üå∏\nLife needs healing, alcohol is too stimulating, the gentlest is still coffee~\n    \nCategory Options: A.

Clean Your Nasal Cavity Daily\n\nFor those with allergic rhinitis or sensitivity to pollen, clean your nasal cavity 2-3 times a day. Special nasal wash devices can be purchased at pharmacies or hospitals. Alternatively, you can use a small inhaler filled with saline solution to thoroughly remove pollen from your nasal cavity.\n\nüå∏2. Choose the Right Time for Outdoor Activities\n\nWillow catkins are usually most abundant at noon, so people with allergies should try to avoid going out during this time. If you need to engage in outdoor activities, choose early morning, evening, or after rain.\n\nüå∏3. \"Arm\" Yourself Before Going Out\n\nWhen going out is necessary, take proper precautions. Masks, glasses, and outerwear are essential. Those who usually wear contact lenses can switch to glasses with lenses to prevent catkins from entering the eyes. If you're concerned about allergic reactions on exposed arms, wear a light jacket.\n\nüå∏4. Remove Willow Catkins with Warm Water\n\nIf your skin comes into contact with willow or poplar catkins, remove them promptly. It's best to clean with warm water, which helps prevent or alleviate allergic symptoms. If symptoms like itching, redness, or pimples are severe, seek medical attention promptly.\n\nüå∏5. Do Not Dry Clothes Outdoors\n\nWhenever possible, dry your clothes indoors. Outdoor drying can easily cause clothes, sheets, and bedding to become contaminated with willow catkins.\n\nCategory Options: A. Games B. Life Records C. Photography D.
