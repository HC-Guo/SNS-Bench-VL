It sounds somewhat reasonable, but let's consider why I chose to setback: 1Ô∏è‚É£Privacy 2Ô∏è‚É£The door opens outward without occupying public space 3Ô∏è‚É£There is some outdoor storage and shoe-changing area. Let's discuss these separately:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£Privacy  Refer to P2. Since my unit is close to the elevator, the straight-line distance from the elevator door might be only about 30cm. My quirky self imagines all neighbors passing by my door when entering and exiting the elevator, causing noise and an uncomfortable glance, so I decided to setback a bit to maintain some privacy.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£Considering the door opening direction  If it opens inward, it occupies internal space, while opening outward saves indoor space but easily occupies public areas. If encountering a particularly picky neighbor, there might be objections. Additionally, considering safety, inward opening has more drawbacks in emergencies (such as fire escape, forced entry [Facepalm R]). After comprehensive consideration, I decided on setback + outward opening [Magnifying Glass R].\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£Considering external storage and shoe-changing area  Actually, my parents' concerns stem from a fixed mindset, thinking that only the space inside the door belongs to the indoors, otherwise it's 'wasteful'. But why not think differently? Ownership, usage, and decision-making are all yours. It's just a redivision of functional areas. Especially for someone like me with mild cleanliness OCD, having a relatively isolated area to store items not suitable for indoors or parcels is a reasonable choice.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£Actually, there's another reason: the original door opening size was too small, only 206√ó97cm. Setback allows for a larger size, making entry and exit less confined.\n\nFinally, I decided on a 110cm setback, combining the dimensions of the Lu Ban ruler, choosing a relatively auspicious size. The final door design and style can be seen in P4.\nThe black door yyds, looking forward to the finished product.\nP5 recently finished muscle training, had a herniated disc episode, after recovery, I plan to start swimming üèäüèª and will share more later.

Out of curiosity, I wanted to find out more, so I placed an order with a reviewer who had excellent credit and many positive reviews. The communication before and after the order was very pleasant. I was worried it might be a scam, so I expressed my concerns to the seller, who reassured me, so I went ahead and placed the order.\nAfter placing the order, I noticed that the shipping address was from Jieyang, Guangdong, but the IP address of the reviewer showed that they were in Beijing. Seeing this information, I knew it was definitely a scam. But my damn curiosity made me want to see what they would actually send me. After waiting for two days, I finally received the package, which contained the two 100% polyester short-sleeve shirts shown in Figure 1. How can I describe them? These shirts look like shirts, but I don't think any normal person would wear them. They are indescribably poor quality. They're not even good enough to be used as rags, and throwing them away would harm the environment and add to the burden of the trash can. I spent 19.9 yuan to buy two pieces of garbage from Guangdong. Although I was deceived, I was willing to take this risk for my curiosity. Every day brings a new scam, each one different.\nBased on the image content, judge the relevance of the query to the content.

I thought it would be fine once I got it into the mold, but the nightmare really began with the freezing process [disappointed R]\nThe first one froze for two hours, and when I took it out, it was too soft to be removed intact from the mold. I thought it was because it hadn't frozen long enough, so I melted another one and froze it for a whole day and night, but when I took it out, it was still soft and couldn't be removed intact.\nNow I realize that many high-end lipsticks can't possibly freeze as hard as an ice pop, if they could, wouldn't chunks of ice fall off your lips in the northern winter? [disappointed R], so I don't know what kind of lipsticks in those modification videos can freeze hard, but you really shouldn't easily try this with expensive lipsticks. If you want to play around, use cheap ones, because it's too heartbreaking when expensive ones fail [laughing-crying R]\n\nBased on the image content, judge the relevance of the query to the content.
