Later, I thought of using a spray, La Roche-Posay's spray is just mineral water without oil, spray a layer and use Nuface without getting shocked, I've been using it this way, and after a period of time, it really had an effect. The key is, spraying a layer before skincare and using Nuface is really more sustainable than washing your face after using the gel. Output format is the option letter, for example, A.\""

Previous studies on the Buguang device have confirmed its effectiveness and safety for 6 months; this is the first paper to report results over 12 months. The results indicate:\nThe control group wearing ordinary glasses had an average myopia degree (spherical equivalent) that increased from 253 to 355 after 12 months, an increase of about 100 degrees; the red light group (using the Buguang device) had an average myopia degree that changed from 252 to 251 after 12 months, with no increase.\nAxial length: The average increase in the ordinary glasses group was 0.59mm, while the Buguang device group had an average decrease of 0.22mm. Additionally, the Buguang device group did not experience any ocular complications such as photophobia, tearing, conjunctival congestion, edema, corneal epithelial damage, lens opacity, or macular damage, nor were there any cognitive impairments or behavioral abnormalities.

Schizophrenia - a severe mental disorder that affects a person's thinking, behavior, and feelings. This disease makes a person realize that they are not in the real world, meaning they live in a separate world.\nBecause Doraemon is suffering from this disease, he does not interact with people. He is bullied at school due to his mental confusion, which makes him even more isolated. Then he begins to imagine a character, that is, Doraemon. In his imagination, Doraemon never leaves him alone, never makes him sad. The small gadgets provided by Doraemon for Doraemon are transplanted\nDepicted as small tools for Doraemon\nIn the Doraemon series.\nBut this is just Doraemon's idea\nHallucinations are not real. A few days later, Doraemon went to a medical consultation. The counselor told us that there is no idea like Doraemon, it is purely a hallucination caused by Doraemon's thoughts.\nHearing this, Doraemon felt sad and lonely again, which made him even more depressed. Doraemon, at the age of 16, shot himself to death\nThen, after hearing Doraemon's profound story of sadness, Fujiko wrote a story and created an anime comic series to pay tribute to Doraemon.\n[Crying R]', the original comment 'Is it really true or not?', now you need to judge which of the following replies is the user's real reply to the original comment.\nA.

Doctors of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine, please tell me how can he get better? Is there any good method?' Original comment: 'Mom has done the genetic test. Now we are using both traditional Chinese and Western medicine, hoping it will be effective [KissR]. Now you need to judge which of the following replies is the user's real reply to the original comment.\nA. I waited in line for half an hour to register, and three hours to get a blood test prescription. Fortunately, the doctor was quite meticulous. Honestly, I wouldn't come to the hospital if I could get better with just some medication. Now I'm waiting for the results and the doctor's diagnosis and prescription... The doctor didn't have lunch until after 1 pm, which isn't easy either. If it weren't for the concern and the need for a blood test, I wouldn't want to go to a large hospital. The child is also tired. I don't want to complain about the situation, I just want to say, may all the angel babies in the world not get sick and stay healthy and safe. It's really tiring, and the damn virus should be eradicated!!\nB. Thanks for the reply. Although there's still a first place above with little chance, hearing about the situation of township civil servants from everyone is really making me shiver [CryR].\nC. It's okay. My daughter had bronchopneumonia two months after the procedure. That time it was actually because I didn't pay enough attention to the child. Later, it was just a common cold, not as serious as before when she had tonsillar abscesses, which was very worrying.\nD. I want to ask, was the genetic test done on the sputum [LaughCryR]?\" Output format is the option letter, for example, A.\""

The package included a pen, but when I received the goods for the first time, I found that the pen couldn't be used. The tablet could connect to the pen, but the pen was unusable. I went to an Apple authorized store to inquire, and found that my pen couldn't be used on their tablets either, and their pens couldn't be used on my tablet either. Since they don't have repairs there, they asked me to contact Jingdong's after-sales service, so I went to the customer service, but Jingdong's customer service was always a robot. After reading Xiaohongshu, I learned that I had to keep sending requests for manual service to get an online customer service response; I spent the first half-hour talking to a robot [petrified R]. Then the customer service replied to me, asking me to apply for after-sales service, and I applied for an exchange. I wasn't sure whether it was the tablet or the pen that was broken, so the customer service asked me to send the whole set back, and I applied for after-sales exchange of the entire package. So far, I am very satisfied with the customer service attitude. On June 8th, I received the exchange package, opened it, and found that a pen was missing. I contacted customer service, and he said he would check it out. Later, I received a reply saying that the accessories were shipped separately, the pen had been inspected and was fine, but he said he didn't know if it had been shipped and couldn't check now. I was not satisfied with this reply. Later, a customer service representative called me and said it was missed in the warehouse, but it hadn't been inspected because I hadn't applied for after-sales service for the pen, but I had initiated after-sales service for the entire package, and the customer service had asked me to send it together, so how could I apply for after-sales service for the pen separately? Moreover, when the customer service told me this, my pen had already exceeded the seven-day unconditional return period, and I could only apply for an exchange. I just wanted them to send me a new pen, but they kept delaying, saying they would give me a reply in a few days.\" The original comment is \"Jingdong's customer service is notoriously bad-tempered.\" Now you need to determine which of the following replies is the user's real reply to the original comment.\nA.

Then I helped my husband transplant the iron tree into a larger pot with soil and fertilizer, and also planted some vegetables, so we won't worry about not having greens during the pandemic. After a simple lunch, I started preparing for dinner—making dumplings. My daughter took care of kneading the dough and mincing the meat, while I was in charge of mixing the filling and washing the chives. I also marinated the duck gizzards bought yesterday. Cleaning the pig intestines took a lot of my time; they are really hard to clean, but my two kids love them, so as a mother, I had to prepare some marinated intestines for my daughter to cook noodle soup with during her holiday at home. By the time I finished all this, it was past 4 PM. I rolled the dumpling wrappers, my daughter filled them, and my son cooked the dumplings, completing the task through teamwork. The four of us ate, and three of us took some for lunch tomorrow, devouring a kilogram of pork and two large bunches of chives, and only a few duck gizzards were left in the pot.

When I took it to the authorized store, the first inspection said it was normal, but then they mentioned that if the issue reoccurred, it might be a problem with the motherboard. Sure enough, the problem happened again soon after, and I began my journey of indecision. I considered switching back to Huawei but it still didn't meet my needs, so I finally opted for the less popular Samsung S20+. I think this blue color looks great.

The width of my wall cabinet is 30, and the base cabinet is flush with the wall at 38.\n2⃣️ The height of the base cabinet should be between 85-90: Generally, the base cabinet in the kitchen operation area is 85, unless all family members are over 175 cm tall (I am 166 cm and tried cutting vegetables in the small appliance area of my 90 cm high cabinet, and it was a bit tiring...). The small appliance area and the sideboard are recommended to be 88-90. With this design, if the room height is higher, even a top-to-bottom wall cabinet won't look out of proportion. The height of my sideboard is 85, which is a bit low.\n3⃣️ The height of the drawers should be at least greater than 18: Drawers are relatively expensive in custom furniture, so they must be designed reasonably. Often, there is not much space left for drawers, and if the height is less than 18, it is not very convenient to use.\n4⃣️ The height for placing wine should be at least 38: My single shelf is around 30-33, so wine cannot be placed directly on it and requires a separate wine rack. If the wine cabinet is to store wine, the height should be greater than 38 or designed with wine compartments.\n[Facepalm R] Picture 6 is my design drawing at that time, and you can see that the cooperation between this local agent and the factory was really not good, as there were discrepancies between the dimensions on the design drawing and the actual dimensions for each item~\"\nOriginal comment: \"Could you please tell me which model the water dispenser is?

What's the use, I experienced it personally. The bookcase, shoe cabinet, and island counter custom-made by the renovation company, the shortest is 80 cm high, the longest is 250 cm high. A total of 11 doors, all made of multi-layer boards, all deformed, and later replaced. The renovation company also wanted to save money and directly added straighteners. But even with straighteners, there's no guarantee against deformation. Because the owner of the renovation company bought a house right below mine and is also renovating. He can't escape the later deformation, so he paid out of his own pocket for the replacement.\nB. It's okay, the windowsill and sink can also be done.\nC.

The article title is: \"The Type of Parent Teachers Fear the Most | I'm Having a Hard Time\"\n\nArticle content: \"I'm really afraid of those parents who overly protect their children, thinking that their kids have a hard time doing homework, thinking that your teaching is incorrect, and feeling heartbroken when you criticize their children...\nFirst of all, as a teacher, one must absolutely have good teacher ethics and professional teaching methods. The school's requirements are also very strict, with arrangements for homework assignments and teaching progress. There are weekly teaching research sessions, where we listen to and evaluate each other's classes.\nThis National Day, I asked the children to write a page of numbers every day to practice handwriting, just to develop good study habits. As the saying goes, 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' Mathematics is very precise, and if handwriting is poor, it can easily lead to careless mistakes in the future. Poor handwriting can easily confuse 6 with 0, and 2 with 7, leading to calculation errors.\nThe parent of this child asked if we could consolidate basic knowledge, but our grade group has already decided on the homework content and it has been arranged. As for handwriting, I just wanted to see how this child writes. If it's very neat, then we can reduce the amount accordingly, especially during the holiday. But after checking the homework, seeing the handwriting like this, why would this parent still question the teacher's arrangement of handwriting practice? [Crying R][Crying R]\"\n\nOriginal comment: \"Actually, I want to say [Laughing Crying R] that assigning written homework should be done cautiously, otherwise if someone complains to the education bureau, we will be the ones who suffer. When I assign written homework, I always say: 'Choose parts to complete based on your own situation.' I'm just afraid of parents catching us out [Crying R]. It's already tiring enough at school.\"\n\nNow, you need to determine which of the following replies is the user's actual response to the original comment.\n\nA. Actually, it's parents like these in Chinese society who harm many people, going to great lengths to give gifts and money to teachers, sending their kids to tutoring classes, which forces other parents to do the same. In the end, everyone is giving gifts, and while the teacher may not remember who gave what, they definitely won't forget those who didn't. They're hurting themselves.\n\nB. If it's for your own home, it can't be called a pitfall, but if it's an investment, you need to consider it carefully [Laughing Crying R].\n\nC. What? Assigning homework can get you reported to the education bureau?\n\nD. Reading the comments is frustrating. Someone even said that reading books is just exam-oriented education. What about the years I spent studying child psychology, education, logic, and other courses in teacher's college? They dismissed it as exam-oriented education. I didn't have a good teacher in sixth grade, even though I was one of the top two students in my school, and often ranked in the top few among 16 schools in our town. Because of the merger of three schools in sixth grade, I went to another school, and although I was one of the top students when I entered, the homeroom teacher often criticized me and two other girls from the same original school for dressing too flashy. She said it more than once, and the problem was that my clothes were bought by my family and were not inappropriate for my age. Because of her, I didn't like going to school later. After studying education, I deeply understand the responsibility and importance of a teacher. I feel that I might not satisfy myself, and after my internship, I didn't choose to become a teacher.\n\nOutput format: Option letter, for example, A."

We named her Chouchou (actually, she doesn't smell at all).\nChouchou was playful and adorable, liked to play with people, and often jumped out of her drawer to sleep under the bed. As long as we brought some food and called her a few times, she would come out.\nLast night, when my daughter came home from school, her dad vividly described how Chouchou caught a small gecko during the day and bit off its tail. Not long after he finished talking, I went into the room to clean her drawer. I didn't pay attention when I opened the door and accidentally caught her head in the door gap, killing her instantly.\nMy daughter cried bitterly, not like a child wailing, but like an adult, sobbing.\nLuckily, her dad was home to handle it. Initially, he wanted to just throw her into the trash can downstairs, but after thinking about it, I asked him to bury Chouchou under a tree in the neighborhood. I asked my daughter if she wanted to come along, but she said no.\nWhile taking a bath, she was still crying. I said we would go see her on Saturday.\nRecording this event is a little way to remember Chouchou.'\nOriginal comment: 'Right, can't even tell the difference between a guinea pig and a bamboo rat...'\nNow you need to determine which of the following replies is the user's genuine response to the original comment.\nA.

Politics is actually the simplest subject, you must have confidence. Except for Marxist philosophy, the other parts of politics are relatively simple. First, master the Marxist philosophy part. It's only March now, no need to rush into doing practice questions. I mainly followed Teacher Xiao Shurong for politics back then. In 2019, he correctly predicted quite a few big questions. You can also listen to several teachers' classes to see who suits you better. Teacher Leg's lectures are also good.\nC. Black B is the only choice, it's unified for the whole city.\nD.

For other teachers' mock papers, I seriously did the multiple-choice questions, and went over the subjective questions about twice (directly looking at the answers and memorizing).

You're exactly right. My baby is almost four months old. My mother-in-law has been helping for over a month, and I'm so tired. I insist on putting the baby to sleep myself. She can't take over, and the baby sleeps with me. But as soon as there's a sound, she immediately pushes the door in, saying the baby has woken up and should play with grandma. After a few times, the baby could only sleep for forty minutes, and I couldn't take it. When she comes in, I don't say anything and keep soothing until the baby falls asleep again, and then she leaves. Whenever we have visitors, she urges me to go out shopping, suggesting my husband take me out for a walk or to the mall, but I don't want to! I just want to be with the baby. I cherish my maternity leave time so much. She keeps talking non-stop, driving me crazy. I directly said I want to resign to take care of the baby; I can't leave him. Then I cried to my husband again, and he told his mom that I'm depressed and don't want to be apart from the baby. They let her take care of the baby more now, and it's much better. Otherwise, I was on the brink of madness recently [laugh-cry emoji].\n\nB. Do you have the salesperson's WeChat?\n\nC. They gave me a year of Tencent Video and a year of JD Plus.\n\nD.

Every day, when I look in the mirror, I find that my pimples are gradually decreasing and my skin is slowly getting better, which really makes me happy.\n✨At first, I really thought the anti-acne cream was very difficult to use! Very much difficult! Initially, I would apply it directly after washing my face, first using the clindamycin prescribed by the hospital, and then after it dried, I would apply the anti-acne cream (by smearing). Then I would notice that the anti-acne cream would turn white and was hard to absorb. I thought it was because I applied too much at first (not true), but even when I applied less, it would still be like that.\n✨Now, my routine with the anti-acne cream is to wash my face, apply toner, then apply clindamycin, and finally dot the anti-acne cream on and pat it in with my fingers. After about half an hour, I use tissue paper to pat my face and absorb some oil. Of course, I do this very rarely, only when I remember.\n✨I'm quite lazy. Dr. Dang Yuping advised applying it twice a day, but sometimes when I don't have classes in the morning, I don't wash my face, meaning I only apply it once in the evening. Sometimes, when I have time, I do a full skincare routine: toner, butter, essence, face cream, clindamycin, anti-acne cream (I still haven't figured out whether to use butter or essence first [DisappointedR]). However, I do this very rarely because I'm afraid it will make my face greasy, as I have combination oily skin. After seeing the doctor, I hardly wear makeup anymore, and I deliberately avoid using facial cleanser when washing my face, so my face doesn't feel tight afterward, and I choose not to do a full skincare routine. Of course, everyone is different, and you should choose based on your skin condition.\n✨The 💊 I got from the hospital should last for another month. I'll update everyone on my skin condition before my next follow-up appointment. It's really slowly getting better 5555555. Because I feel my skin is improving, the phrase I most often say to my mom on the phone recently is that the thousand yuan wasn't wasted [LaughingR].\n✨In the end, it's the same old saying: if you have acne, see a doctor! You must see a doctor! Don't trust other people's acne removal methods. Skincare products and masks won't make your acne disappear, but a doctor will!\n#Rosacea[Topic]#\nUpdate ---------------\nI asked Dr. Dang last night, and he said to use clindamycin before skincare. Since I've already stopped using the anti-acne cream, I didn't ask about it, but it's probably also used before skincare (just a personal guess).\"\nOriginal comment: \"It might be a bit allergic, contact the doctor to ask what's going on.\"\nNow, you need to determine which of the following replies is the user's actual response to the original comment.\nA.
